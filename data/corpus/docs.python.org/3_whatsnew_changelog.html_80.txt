  * [gh-117114](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/117114): Make [`os.path.isdevdrive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isdevdrive "os.path.isdevdrive") available on all platforms. For those that do not offer Dev Drives, it will always return `False`.
  * [gh-117110](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/117110): Fix a bug that prevents subclasses of [`typing.Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") to be instantiated with arguments. Patch by Chris Fu.
  * [gh-109653](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109653): Deferred select imports in importlib.metadata and importlib.resources for a 14% speedup.
  * [gh-70647](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/70647): Start the deprecation period for the current behavior of [`datetime.datetime.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime") and [`time.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") which always fails to parse a date string with a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") involving a day of month such as `strptime("02-29", "%m-%d")` when a year is **not** specified and the date happen to be February 29th. This should help avoid users finding new bugs every four years due to a natural mistaken assumption about the API when parsing partial date values.
  * [gh-116987](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116987): Fixed `inspect.findsource()` for class code objects.
  * [gh-114099](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099): Modify standard library to allow for iOS platform differences.
  * [gh-90872](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90872): On Windows, [`subprocess.Popen.wait()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait "subprocess.Popen.wait") no longer calls `WaitForSingleObject()` with a negative timeout: pass `0` ms if the timeout is negative. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-116957](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116957): configparser: Donâ€™t leave ConfigParser values in an invalid state (stored as a list instead of a str) after an earlier read raised DuplicateSectionError or DuplicateOptionError.
  * [gh-115538](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115538): `_io.WindowsConsoleIO` now emit a warning if a boolean value is passed as a filedescriptor argument.
  * [gh-90095](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90095): Ignore empty lines and comments in `.pdbrc`
  * [gh-106531](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106531): Refreshed zipfile._path from [zipp 3.18](https://zipp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v3-18-0), providing better compatibility for PyPy, better glob performance for deeply nested zipfiles, and providing internal access to `CompleteDirs.inject` for use in other tests (like importlib.resources).
  * [gh-63207](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/63207): On Windows, [`time.time()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time "time.time") now uses the `GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime()` clock to have a resolution better than 1 us, instead of the `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()` clock which has a resolution of 15.6 ms. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-116764](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116764): Restore support of `None` and other false values in [`urllib.parse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#module-urllib.parse "urllib.parse: Parse URLs into or assemble them from components.") functions [`parse_qs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.parse_qs "urllib.parse.parse_qs") and [`parse_qsl()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.parse_qsl "urllib.parse.parse_qsl").

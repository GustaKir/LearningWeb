Title: Improvements in asyncio Module for Python 3.7
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html
Summary: Python 3.7 introduces significant optimizations in the asyncio module, including a C implementation of `asyncio.get_event_loop()`, improving its performance by up to 15 times. Additionally, callback management for `asyncio.Future` has been optimized, enhancing efficiency in handling asynchronous calls.

The [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") module received a number of notable optimizations for commonly used functions:
  * The [`asyncio.get_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_event_loop "asyncio.get_event_loop") function has been reimplemented in C to make it up to 15 times faster. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov in [bpo-32296](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32296).)
  * [`asyncio.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") callback management has been optimized. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov in [bpo-32348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32348).)
  * [`asyncio.gather()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.gather "asyncio.gather") is now up to 15% faster. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov in [bpo-32355](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32355).)
  * [`asyncio.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.sleep "asyncio.sleep") is now up to 2 times faster when the _delay_ argument is zero or negative. (Contributed by Andrew Svetlov in [bpo-32351](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32351).)
  * The performance overhead of asyncio debug mode has been reduced. (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou in [bpo-31970](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31970).)

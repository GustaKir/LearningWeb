Title: Python 3 Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Recent updates include measures to prevent slow filesystem bottlenecks while spawning binaries, GIL release improvements during hashlib computations for SHA families and MD5, and enhanced performance for pathlib.Path.glob() by optimizing path filtering.
---

This prevents spawning a binary from a slow filesystem from blocking the rest of the application.
  * [gh-99108](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99108): We now release the GIL around built-in [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.") computations of reasonable size for the SHA families and MD5 hash functions, matching what our OpenSSL backed hash computations already does.
  * [gh-102613](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102613): Improve performance of [`pathlib.Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") when expanding a pattern with a non-terminal “`**`” component by filtering walked paths through a regular expression, rather than calling [`os.scandir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir "os.scandir") more than once on each directory.
  * [gh-104399](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104399): Prepare the `_tkinter` module for building with Tcl 9.0 and future libtommath by replacing usage of deprecated functions `mp_to_unsigned_bin_n()` and `mp_unsigned_bin_size()` when necessary.
  * [gh-102676](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102676): Add fields `start_offset`, `cache_offset`, `end_offset`, `baseopname`, `baseopcode`, `jump_target` and `oparg` to [`dis.Instruction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#dis.Instruction "dis.Instruction").
  * [gh-103558](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103558): Fixed `parent` argument validation mechanism of [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library."). Improved test coverage.
  * [gh-103464](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103464): Provide helpful usage messages when parsing incorrect [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") commands.
  * [gh-103384](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103384): Generalize the regex pattern `BaseConfigurator.INDEX_PATTERN` to allow spaces and non-alphanumeric characters in keys.
  * [gh-103124](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103124): Added multiline statement support for [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  * [gh-101162](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101162): Forbid using `builtins.issubclass()` with [`types.GenericAlias`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.GenericAlias "types.GenericAlias") as the first argument.
  * [gh-103200](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103200): Fix cache repopulation semantics of zipimport.invalidate_caches().

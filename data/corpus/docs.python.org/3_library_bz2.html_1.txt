Title: Opening Bzip2-Compressed Files with bz2.open
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html
Summary: The `bz2.open` function allows users to open bzip2-compressed files in either binary or text mode, returning a file object. It accepts a filename or file object, with various modes for reading and writing. The compression level can be specified from 1 to 9.

bz2.open(_filename_ , _mode ='rb'_, _compresslevel =9_, _encoding =None_, _errors =None_, _newline =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.open "Link to this definition")
    
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object).
As with the constructor for [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File"), the _filename_ argument can be an actual filename (a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") or [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.
The _mode_ argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'w'`, `'wb'`, `'x'`, `'xb'`, `'a'` or `'ab'` for binary mode, or `'rt'`, `'wt'`, `'xt'`, or `'at'` for text mode. The default is `'rb'`.
The _compresslevel_ argument is an integer from 1 to 9, as for the [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") constructor.
For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") constructor: `BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel=compresslevel)`. In this case, the _encoding_ , _errors_ and _newline_ arguments must not be provided.
For text mode, a [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") object is created, and wrapped in an [`io.TextIOWrapper`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper") instance with the specified encoding, error handling behavior, and line ending(s).
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.4: The `'x'` (exclusive creation) mode was added.
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object). 

_class_ bz2.BZ2File(_filename_ , _mode ='r'_, _*_ , _compresslevel =9_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "Link to this definition")
    
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary mode.
If _filename_ is a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") or [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object, open the named file directly. Otherwise, _filename_ should be a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object), which will be used to read or write the compressed data.
The _mode_ argument can be either `'r'` for reading (default), `'w'` for overwriting, `'x'` for exclusive creation, or `'a'` for appending. These can equivalently be given as `'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'xb'` and `'ab'` respectively.
If _filename_ is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of `'w'` does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to `'a'`.
If _mode_ is `'w'` or `'a'`, _compresslevel_ can be an integer between `1` and `9` specifying the level of compression: `1` produces the least compression, and `9` (default) produces the most compression.
If _mode_ is `'r'`, the input file may be the concatenation of multiple compressed streams.
[`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") provides all of the members specified by the [`io.BufferedIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase"), except for [`detach()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.detach "io.BufferedIOBase.detach") and [`truncate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.truncate "io.IOBase.truncate"). Iteration and the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement are supported.
[`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") also provides the following methods and attributes: 

peek([_n_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.peek "Link to this definition")
    
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one byte of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes returned is unspecified.
Note
While calling [`peek()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.peek "bz2.BZ2File.peek") does not change the file position of the [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File"), it may change the position of the underlying file object (e.g. if the [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File") was constructed by passing a file object for _filename_).
Added in version 3.3. 

fileno()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.fileno "Link to this definition")
    
Return the file descriptor for the underlying file.
Added in version 3.3. 

readable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.readable "Link to this definition")
    
Return whether the file was opened for reading.
Added in version 3.3.

Title: Python 3.3 Release Notes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html
Summary: Highlights of Python 3.3 include the deprecation of the `unicode_internal` codec and the introduction of the `ChainMap` class in the `collections` module, which allows treating multiple mappings as a single unit. Additionally, abstract base classes have been moved to a new `collections.abc` module for better organization.

The `unicode_internal` codec has been deprecated.
### collections[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#collections "Link to this heading")
Addition of a new [`ChainMap`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.ChainMap "collections.ChainMap") class to allow treating a number of mappings as a single unit. (Written by Raymond Hettinger for [bpo-11089](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=11089), made public in [bpo-11297](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=11297).)
The abstract base classes have been moved in a new [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers") module, to better differentiate between the abstract and the concrete collections classes. Aliases for ABCs are still present in the [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") module to preserve existing imports. ([bpo-11085](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=11085))
The [`Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter "collections.Counter") class now supports the unary `+` and `-` operators, as well as the in-place operators `+=`, `-=`, `|=`, and `&=`. (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in [bpo-13121](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13121).)
### contextlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#contextlib "Link to this heading")
[`ExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") now provides a solid foundation for programmatic manipulation of context managers and similar cleanup functionality. Unlike the previous `contextlib.nested` API (which was deprecated and removed), the new API is designed to work correctly regardless of whether context managers acquire their resources in their `__init__` method (for example, file objects) or in their `__enter__` method (for example, synchronisation objects from the [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module).
([bpo-13585](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13585))
### crypt[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#crypt "Link to this heading")
Addition of salt and modular crypt format (hashing method) and the `mksalt()` function to the `crypt` module.
([bpo-10924](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10924))
### curses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#curses "Link to this heading")
  * If the [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") module is linked to the ncursesw library, use Unicode functions when Unicode strings or characters are passed (e.g. `waddwstr()`), and bytes functions otherwise (e.g. `waddstr()`).
  * Use the locale encoding instead of `utf-8` to encode Unicode strings.
  * `curses.window` has a new [`curses.window.encoding`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.encoding "curses.window.encoding") attribute.
  * The `curses.window` class has a new [`get_wch()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.get_wch "curses.window.get_wch") method to get a wide character
  * The [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") module has a new [`unget_wch()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.unget_wch "curses.unget_wch") function to push a wide character so the next [`get_wch()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.get_wch "curses.window.get_wch") will return it

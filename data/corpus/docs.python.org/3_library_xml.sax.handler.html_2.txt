Title: Overview of xml.sax.handler in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html
Summary: The xml.sax.handler module includes a list of known property names and outlines the use of ContentHandler objects, which users should subclass to interact with the SAX parser. The ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator method provides a way for the parser to give the application a locator for document event origins.

xml.sax.handler.all_properties[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.all_properties "Link to this definition")
    
List of all known property names.
## ContentHandler Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#contenthandler-objects "Link to this heading")
Users are expected to subclass [`ContentHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler "xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler") to support their application. The following methods are called by the parser on the appropriate events in the input document: 

ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator(_locator_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator "Link to this definition")
    
Called by the parser to give the application a locator for locating the origin of document events.
SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely required) to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply the locator to the application by invoking this method before invoking any of the other methods in the DocumentHandler interface.
The locator allows the application to determine the end position of any document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an error. Typically, the application will use this information for reporting its own errors (such as character content that does not match an application’s business rules). The information returned by the locator is probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.
Note that the locator will return correct information only during the invocation of the events in this interface. The application should not attempt to use it at any other time. 

ContentHandler.startDocument()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler.startDocument "Link to this definition")
    
Receive notification of the beginning of a document.
The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, before any other methods in this interface or in DTDHandler (except for [`setDocumentLocator()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator "xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator")). 

ContentHandler.endDocument()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html#xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler.endDocument "Link to this definition")
    
Receive notification of the end of a document.
The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, and it will be the last method invoked during the parse. The parser shall not invoke this method until it has either abandoned parsing (because of an unrecoverable error) or reached the end of input.

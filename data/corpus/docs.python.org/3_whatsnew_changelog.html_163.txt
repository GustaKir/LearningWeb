### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id138 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-104719](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104719): Remove IDLE’s modification of tokenize.tabsize and test other uses of tokenize data and methods.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id139 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-109991](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109991): Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.11 and multissltests to use 1.1.1w, 3.0.11, and 3.1.3.
  * [gh-108494](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108494): [Argument Clinic](https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/) now has a partial support of the [Limited API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-c-api): see [documentation in the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/#clinic-howto-limited-capi) Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-107704](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107704): It is now possible to deprecate passing keyword arguments for keyword-or-positional parameters with Argument Clinic, using the new `/ [from X.Y]` syntax. (To be read as _“positional-only from Python version X.Y”_.) See [documentation in the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/#clinic-howto-deprecate-keyword) for more information.
  * [gh-107880](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107880): Argument Clinic can now clone `__init__()` and `__new__()` methods.
  * [gh-104683](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104683): Add `--exclude` option to Argument Clinic CLI.
  * [gh-95065](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95065): Argument Clinic now supports overriding automatically generated signature by using directive `@text_signature`. See [documentation in the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/#clinic-howto-override-signature)
  * [gh-107609](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107609): Fix duplicate module check in Argument Clinic. Previously, a duplicate definition would incorrectly be silently accepted. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
  * [gh-107467](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107467): The Argument Clinic command-line tool now prints to stderr instead of stdout on failure.
  * [gh-106970](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106970): Fix bugs in the Argument Clinic `destination <name> clear` command; the destination buffers would never be cleared, and the `destination` directive parser would simply continue to the fault handler after processing the command. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
  * [gh-106706](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106706): Change bytecode syntax for families to remove redundant name matching pseudo syntax.
  * [gh-106359](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106359): Argument Clinic now explicitly forbids “kwarg splats” in function calls used as annotations.
  * [gh-103186](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103186): `freeze` now fetches `CONFIG_ARGS` from the original CPython instance the Makefile uses to call utility scripts. Patch by Ijtaba Hussain.
  * [gh-95065](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95065): It is now possible to deprecate passing parameters positionally with Argument Clinic, using the new `* [from X.Y]` syntax. (To be read as _“keyword-only from Python version X.Y”_.) See [documentation in the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/#clinic-howto-deprecate-positional) for more information. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland with help from Alex Waygood, Nikita Sobolev, and Serhiy Storchaka.

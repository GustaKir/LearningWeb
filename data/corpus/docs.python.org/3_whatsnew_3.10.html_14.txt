Title: Python 3.10 Changes: glob and hashlib Modules
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html
Summary: Python 3.10 introduces the _root_dir_ and _dir_fd_ parameters in the glob() and iglob() functions for specifying root directories during file searching. Additionally, the hashlib module now requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher and offers preliminary support for OpenSSL 3.0.0, with noted contributions by Serhiy Storchaka and Christian Heimes.

d the _root_dir_ and _dir_fd_ parameters in [`glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.glob "glob.glob") and [`iglob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.iglob "glob.iglob") which allow to specify the root directory for searching.

### hashlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#hashlib "Link to this heading")
The hashlib module requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [**PEP 644**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0644/) and [bpo-43669](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43669).)
The hashlib module has preliminary support for OpenSSL 3.0.0. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [bpo-38820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38820) and other issues.)
The pure-Python fallback of [`pbkdf2_hmac()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac "hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac") is deprecated. In the future PBKDF2-HMAC will only be available when Python has been built with OpenSSL support. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [bpo-43880](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43880).)
### hmac[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#hmac "Link to this heading")
The hmac module now uses OpenSSL’s HMAC implementation internally. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [bpo-40645](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40645).)
### IDLE and idlelib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#idle-and-idlelib "Link to this heading")
Make IDLE invoke [`sys.excepthook()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook "sys.excepthook") (when started without ‘-n’). User hooks were previously ignored. (Contributed by Ken Hilton in [bpo-43008](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43008).)
Rearrange the settings dialog. Split the General tab into Windows and Shell/Ed tabs. Move help sources, which extend the Help menu, to the Extensions tab. Make space for new options and shorten the dialog. The latter makes the dialog better fit small screens. (Contributed by Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-40468](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40468).) Move the indent space setting from the Font tab to the new Windows tab. (Contributed by Mark Roseman and Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-33962](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33962).)
The changes above were backported to a 3.9 maintenance release.
Add a Shell sidebar. Move the primary prompt (‘>>>’) to the sidebar. Add secondary prompts (’…’) to the sidebar. Left click and optional drag selects one or more lines of text, as with the editor line number sidebar. Right click after selecting text lines displays a context menu with ‘copy with prompts’. This zips together prompts from the sidebar with lines from the selected text. This option also appears on the context menu for the text. (Contributed by Tal Einat in [bpo-37903](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37903).)
Use spaces instead of tabs to indent interactive code. This makes interactive code entries ‘look right’. Making this feasible was a major motivation for adding the shell sidebar. (Contributed by Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-37892](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37892).)
Highlight the new [soft keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords) [`match`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match), [`case`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match), and [`_`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#wildcard-patterns) in pattern-matching statements. However, this highlighting is not perfect and will be incorrect in some rare cases, including some `_`-s in `case` patterns. (Contributed by Tal Einat in [bpo-44010](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44010).)
New in 3.10 maintenance releases.
Apply syntax highlighting to `.pyi` files. (Contributed by Alex Waygood and Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-45447](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45447).)
Include prompts when saving Shell with inputs and outputs. (Contributed by Terry Jan Reedy in [gh-95191](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95191).)
### importlib.metadata[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#importlib-metadata "Link to this heading")
Feature parity with `importlib_metadata` 4.6 ([history](https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html)).
[importlib.metadata entry points](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#entry-points) now provide a nicer experience for selecting entry points by group and name through a new [importlib.metadata.EntryPoints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#entry-points) class.

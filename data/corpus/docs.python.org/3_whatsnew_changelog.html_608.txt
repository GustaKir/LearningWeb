  * [bpo-29979](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29979): rewrite cgi.parse_multipart, reusing the FieldStorage class and making its results consistent with those of FieldStorage for multipart/form-data requests. Patch by Pierre Quentel.
  * [bpo-30243](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30243): Removed the __init__ methods of _json’s scanner and encoder. Misusing them could cause memory leaks or crashes. Now scanner and encoder objects are completely initialized in the __new__ methods.
  * [bpo-30215](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30215): Compiled regular expression objects with the re.LOCALE flag no longer depend on the locale at compile time. Only the locale at matching time affects the result of matching.
  * [bpo-30185](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30185): Avoid KeyboardInterrupt tracebacks in forkserver helper process when Ctrl-C is received.
  * [bpo-30103](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30103): binascii.b2a_uu() and uu.encode() now support using `'`'` as zero instead of space.
  * [bpo-28556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28556): Various updates to typing module: add typing.NoReturn type, use WrapperDescriptorType, minor bug-fixes. Original PRs by Jim Fasarakis-Hilliard and Ivan Levkivskyi.
  * [bpo-30205](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30205): Fix getsockname() for unbound AF_UNIX sockets on Linux.
  * [bpo-30228](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30228): The seek() and tell() methods of io.FileIO now set the internal seekable attribute to avoid one syscall on open() (in buffered or text mode).
  * [bpo-30190](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30190): unittest’s assertAlmostEqual and assertNotAlmostEqual provide a better message in case of failure which includes the difference between left and right arguments. (patch by Giampaolo Rodola’)
  * [bpo-30101](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30101): Add support for curses.A_ITALIC.
  * [bpo-29822](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29822): inspect.isabstract() now works during __init_subclass__. Patch by Nate Soares.
  * [bpo-29960](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29960): Preserve generator state when _random.Random.setstate() raises an exception. Patch by Bryan Olson.
  * [bpo-30070](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30070): Fixed leaks and crashes in errors handling in the parser module.
  * [bpo-22352](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22352): Column widths in the output of dis.dis() are now adjusted for large line numbers and instruction offsets.
  * [bpo-30061](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30061): Fixed crashes in IOBase methods __next__() and readlines() when readline() or __next__() respectively return non-sizeable object. Fixed possible other errors caused by not checking results of PyObject_Size(), PySequence_Size(), or PyMapping_Size().
  * [bpo-30218](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30218): Fix PathLike support for shutil.unpack_archive. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-10076](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10076): Compiled regular expression and match objects in the re module now support copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() (they are considered atomic).
  * [bpo-30068](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30068): _io._IOBase.readlines will check if it’s closed first when hint is present.
  * [bpo-29694](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29694): Fixed race condition in pathlib mkdir with flags parents=True. Patch by Armin Rigo.

  * [bpo-30017](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30017): Allowed calling the close() method of the zip entry writer object multiple times.

Title: LoggerAdapter Objects
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html
Summary: This section discusses `LoggerAdapter` instances in Python's logging library, which allow for the inclusion of contextual information in logging calls. It highlights the usage of `threadID`, `threadName`, and `taskName` attributes and notes changes made in version 3.1 and 3.12 regarding these attributes.

Thread ID (if available).  
threadName | `%(threadName)s` | Thread name (if available).  
taskName | `%(taskName)s` | [`asyncio.Task`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") name (if available).  
Changed in version 3.1: _processName_ was added.
Changed in version 3.12: _taskName_ was added.
## LoggerAdapter Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#loggeradapter-objects "Link to this heading")
[`LoggerAdapter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter "logging.LoggerAdapter") instances are used to conveniently pass contextual information into logging calls. For a usage example, see the section on [adding contextual information to your logging output](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#context-info). 

_class_ logging.LoggerAdapter(_logger_ , _extra_ , _merge_extra =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter "Link to this definition")
    
Returns an instance of [`LoggerAdapter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter "logging.LoggerAdapter") initialized with an underlying [`Logger`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger "logging.Logger") instance, a dict-like object (_extra_), and a boolean (_merge_extra_) indicating whether or not the _extra_ argument of individual log calls should be merged with the [`LoggerAdapter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter "logging.LoggerAdapter") extra. The default behavior is to ignore the _extra_ argument of individual log calls and only use the one of the [`LoggerAdapter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter "logging.LoggerAdapter") instance 

process(_msg_ , _kwargs_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter.process "Link to this definition")
    
Modifies the message and/or keyword arguments passed to a logging call in order to insert contextual information. This implementation takes the object passed as _extra_ to the constructor and adds it to _kwargs_ using key ‘extra’. The return value is a (_msg_ , _kwargs_) tuple which has the (possibly modified) versions of the arguments passed in. 

manager[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LoggerAdapter.manager "Link to this definition")
    
Delegates to the underlying `manager` on _logger_.

Title: Python 2.2 Release Notes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.2.html
Summary: The Python 2.2 update introduces enhancements in the `imaplib` module, adding support for new extensions like NAMESPACE and capabilities defined in RFCs 2342, along with the addition of email parsing compliance with RFC 2822 in the `rfc822` module. A new package `email` is introduced for parsing and generating email messages.

  * The [`imaplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#module-imaplib "imaplib: IMAP4 protocol client \(requires sockets\).") module, maintained by Piers Lauder, has support for several new extensions: the NAMESPACE extension defined in [**RFC 2342**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2342.html), SORT, GETACL and SETACL. (Contributed by Anthony Baxter and Michel Pelletier.)
  * The `rfc822` module’s parsing of email addresses is now compliant with [**RFC 2822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html), an update to [**RFC 822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822.html). (The module’s name is _not_ going to be changed to `rfc2822`.) A new package, [`email`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages."), has also been added for parsing and generating e-mail messages. (Contributed by Barry Warsaw, and arising out of his work on Mailman.)
  * The [`difflib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#module-difflib "difflib: Helpers for computing differences between objects.") module now contains a new `Differ` class for producing human-readable lists of changes (a “delta”) between two sequences of lines of text. There are also two generator functions, `ndiff()` and `restore()`, which respectively return a delta from two sequences, or one of the original sequences from a delta. (Grunt work contributed by David Goodger, from ndiff.py code by Tim Peters who then did the generatorization.)
  * New constants `ascii_letters`, `ascii_lowercase`, and `ascii_uppercase` were added to the [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations.") module. There were several modules in the standard library that used `string.letters` to mean the ranges A-Za-z, but that assumption is incorrect when locales are in use, because `string.letters` varies depending on the set of legal characters defined by the current locale. The buggy modules have all been fixed to use `ascii_letters` instead. (Reported by an unknown person; fixed by Fred L. Drake, Jr.)
  * The [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types.") module now makes it easier to use alternative MIME-type databases by the addition of a [`MimeTypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.MimeTypes "mimetypes.MimeTypes") class, which takes a list of filenames to be parsed. (Contributed by Fred L. Drake, Jr.)
  * A [`Timer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Timer "threading.Timer") class was added to the [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module that allows scheduling an activity to happen at some future time.

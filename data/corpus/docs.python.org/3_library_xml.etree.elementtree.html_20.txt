Title: XMLPullParser Event Handling
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
Summary: Events from the `read_events()` method in `XMLPullParser` are consumed from an internal queue and will not be yielded again, leading to unpredictable results when multiple readers iterate over the same events. The `start` event is emitted only after the '>' character of a starting tag is seen, while the text and tail attributes remain undefined at that moment.
---

Events provided in a previous call to [`read_events()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.read_events "xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.read_events") will not be yielded again. Events are consumed from the internal queue only when they are retrieved from the iterator, so multiple readers iterating in parallel over iterators obtained from [`read_events()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.read_events "xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.read_events") will have unpredictable results.
Note
[`XMLPullParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser "xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser") only guarantees that it has seen the “>” character of a starting tag when it emits a “start” event, so the attributes are defined, but the contents of the text and tail attributes are undefined at that point. The same applies to the element children; they may or may not be present.
If you need a fully populated element, look for “end” events instead.
Added in version 3.4.
Changed in version 3.8: The `comment` and `pi` events were added.
### Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#exceptions "Link to this heading") 

_class_ xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError "Link to this definition")
    
XML parse error, raised by the various parsing methods in this module when parsing fails. The string representation of an instance of this exception will contain a user-friendly error message. In addition, it will have the following attributes available:

A numeric error code from the expat parser. See the documentation of [`xml.parsers.expat`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#module-xml.parsers.expat "xml.parsers.expat: An interface to the Expat non-validating XML parser.") for the list of error codes and their meanings.

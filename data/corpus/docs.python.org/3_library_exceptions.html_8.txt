Title: TypeError Exception in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html
Summary: The TypeError is raised when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. It provides a message detailing the type mismatch and is used to indicate unsupported operations. If an operation is intended but not implemented, a NotImplementedError should be raised instead.

_exception_ TypeError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch.
This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be. If an object is meant to support a given operation but has not yet provided an implementation, [`NotImplementedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError") is the proper exception to raise.
Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") when an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") is expected) should result in a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"), but passing arguments with the wrong value (e.g. a number outside expected boundaries) should result in a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). 

_exception_ UnboundLocalError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnboundLocalError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable. This is a subclass of [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError"). 

_exception_ UnicodeError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs. It is a subclass of [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").
[`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError") has attributes that describe the encoding or decoding error. For example, `err.object[err.start:err.end]` gives the particular invalid input that the codec failed on. 

encoding[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.encoding "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the encoding that raised the error. 

reason[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.reason "Link to this definition")
    
A string describing the specific codec error. 

object[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.object "Link to this definition")
    
The object the codec was attempting to encode or decode. 

start[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.start "Link to this definition")
    
The first index of invalid data in [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"). 

end[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.end "Link to this definition")
    
The index after the last invalid data in [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object"). 

_exception_ UnicodeEncodeError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeEncodeError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding. It is a subclass of [`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError"). 

_exception_ UnicodeDecodeError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding. It is a subclass of [`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError"). 

_exception_ UnicodeTranslateError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeTranslateError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translating. It is a subclass of [`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError"). 

_exception_ ValueError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError"). 

_exception_ ZeroDivisionError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. The associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the operation.
The following exceptions are kept for compatibility with previous versions; starting from Python 3.3, they are aliases of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").

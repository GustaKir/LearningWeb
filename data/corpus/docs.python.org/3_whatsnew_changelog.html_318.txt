## Python 3.11.0 alpha 1[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-11-0-alpha-1 "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2021-10-05_
### Security[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id278 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-42278](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42278): Replaced usage of [`tempfile.mktemp()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mktemp "tempfile.mktemp") with [`TemporaryDirectory`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryDirectory "tempfile.TemporaryDirectory") to avoid a potential race condition.
  * [bpo-44600](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44600): Fix incorrect line numbers while tracing some failed patterns in [match](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match) statements. Patch by Charles Burkland.
  * [bpo-41180](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=41180): Add auditing events to the [`marshal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html#module-marshal "marshal: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back \(with different constraints\).") module, and stop raising `code.__init__` events for every unmarshalled code object. Directly instantiated code objects will continue to raise an event, and audit event handlers should inspect or collect the raw marshal data. This reduces a significant performance overhead when loading from `.pyc` files.
  * [bpo-44394](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44394): Update the vendored copy of libexpat to 2.4.1 (from 2.2.8) to get the fix for the [**CVE 2013-0340**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0340) “Billion Laughs” vulnerability. This copy is most used on Windows and macOS.
  * [bpo-43124](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43124): Made the internal `putcmd` function in [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") sanitize input for presence of `\r` and `\n` characters to avoid (unlikely) command injection.
  * [bpo-44022](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44022): [`http.client`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#module-http.client "http.client: HTTP and HTTPS protocol client \(requires sockets\).") now avoids infinitely reading potential HTTP headers after a `100 Continue` status response from the server.

---

set(_value_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Spinbox.set "Link to this definition")
    
Sets the value of the spinbox to _value_.
## Notebook[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#notebook "Link to this heading")
Ttk Notebook widget manages a collection of windows and displays a single one at a time. Each child window is associated with a tab, which the user may select to change the currently displayed window.
### Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#id3 "Link to this heading")
This widget accepts the following specific options:
Option | Description  
---|---  
height | If present and greater than zero, specifies the desired height of the pane area (not including internal padding or tabs). Otherwise, the maximum height of all panes is used.  
padding | Specifies the amount of extra space to add around the outside of the notebook. The padding is a list up to four length specifications left top right bottom. If fewer than four elements are specified, bottom defaults to top, right defaults to left, and top defaults to left.  
width | If present and greater than zero, specified the desired width of the pane area (not including internal padding). Otherwise, the maximum width of all panes is used.  
### Tab Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tab-options "Link to this heading")
There are also specific options for tabs:
Option | Description  
---|---  
state | Either “normal”, “disabled” or “hidden”. If “disabled”, then the tab is not selectable. If “hidden”, then the tab is not shown.  
sticky | Specifies how the child window is positioned within the pane area. Value is a string containing zero or more of the characters “n”, “s”, “e” or “w”. Each letter refers to a side (north, south, east or west) that the child window will stick to, as per the `grid()` geometry manager.  
padding | Specifies the amount of extra space to add between the notebook and this pane. Syntax is the same as for the option padding used by this widget.  
text | Specifies a text to be displayed in the tab.  
image | Specifies an image to display in the tab. See the option image described in [`Widget`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Widget "tkinter.ttk.Widget").  
compound | Specifies how to display the image relative to the text, in the case both options text and image are present. See [Label Options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#label-options) for legal values.  
underline | Specifies the index (0-based) of a character to underline in the text string. The underlined character is used for mnemonic activation if [`Notebook.enable_traversal()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.enable_traversal "tkinter.ttk.Notebook.enable_traversal") is called.  
### Tab Identifiers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tab-identifiers "Link to this heading")
The tab_id present in several methods of `ttk.Notebook` may take any of the following forms:
  * An integer between zero and the number of tabs
  * The name of a child window
  * A positional specification of the form “@x,y”, which identifies the tab
  * The literal string “current”, which identifies the currently selected tab
  * The literal string “end”, which returns the number of tabs (only valid for [`Notebook.index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.index "tkinter.ttk.Notebook.index"))


### Virtual Events[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#id4 "Link to this heading")
This widget generates a **< <NotebookTabChanged>>** virtual event after a new tab is selected.

Title: Python 3.10 Changelog
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document includes updates on various components in Python 3.10. Key changes address fixes in IDLE for issues like hang-ups during rapid output and padding in dialog windows. Documentation enhancements include updates for Mac setup and a new guide for Android platforms, while core and builtins adjustments involve a reversion of the incremental garbage collection.

### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id33 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-112938](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112938): Fix uninteruptable hang when Shell gets rapid continuous output.
  * [gh-120104](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120104): Fix padding in config and search dialog windows in IDLE.


### Documentation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id34 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124720](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124720): Update “Using Python on a Mac” section of the “Python Setup and Usage” document and include information on installing free-threading support.
  * [gh-116622](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622): Add an Android platform guide, and flag modules not available on Android.


### Core and Builtins[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id35 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124567](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124567): Revert the incremental GC (in 3.13), since it’s not clear the benefits outweigh the costs at this point.
  * [gh-124642](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124642): Fixed scalability issue in free-threaded builds for lock-free reads from dictionaries in multi-threaded scenarios
  * [gh-116510](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116510): Fix a bug that can cause a crash when sub-interpreters use “basic” single-phase extension modules. Shared objects could refer to PyGC_Head nodes that had been freed as part of interpreter cleanup.
  * [gh-124547](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124547): When deallocating an object with inline values whose `__dict__` is still live: if memory allocation for the inline values fails, clear the dictionary. Prevents an interpreter crash.
  * [gh-124513](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124513): Fix a crash in FrameLocalsProxy constructor: check the number of arguments. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-124442](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124442): Fix nondeterminism in compilation by sorting the value of [`__static_attributes__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#type.__static_attributes__ "type.__static_attributes__"). Patch by kp2pml30.
  * [gh-123856](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123856): Fix PyREPL failure when a keyboard interrupt is triggered after using a history search
  * [gh-65961](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/65961): Document the deprecation of setting and using `__package__` and `__cached__`.
  * [gh-124027](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124027): Support `<page up>`, `<page down>`, and `<delete>` keys in the Python REPL when `$TERM` is set to `vt100`.
  * [gh-77894](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77894): Fix possible crash in the garbage collector when it tries to break a reference loop containing a [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") object. Now a `memoryview` object can only be cleared if there are no buffers that refer it.
  * [gh-123339](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123339): Setting the `__module__` attribute for a class now removes the `__firstlineno__` item from the type’s dict, so they will no longer be inconsistent.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id36 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124160](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124160): Fix crash when importing modules containing state and single-phase initialization in a subinterpreter.
  * [gh-123880](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123880): Fixed a bug that prevented circular imports of extension modules that use single-phase initialization.


### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id37 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124487](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124487): Windows builds now use Windows 8.1 as their API baseline (installation already required Windows 8.1).
  * [gh-124043](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124043): Building using [`--with-trace-refs`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-trace-refs) is (temporarily) disallowed when the GIL is disabled.

### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id38 "Link to this heading")

Title: IPv4Network Attributes in Python's ipaddress Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html
Summary: This section covers several attributes of the IPv4Network class in the Python ipaddress module, including version, max_prefixlen, and boolean checks for multicast, private, unspecified, reserved, and loopback addresses.
---

version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.version "Link to this definition")


max_prefixlen[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.max_prefixlen "Link to this definition")
    
Refer to the corresponding attribute documentation in [`IPv4Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address"). 

is_multicast[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_multicast "Link to this definition")


is_private[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_private "Link to this definition")


is_unspecified[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_unspecified "Link to this definition")


is_reserved[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_reserved "Link to this definition")


is_loopback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_loopback "Link to this definition")


is_link_local[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_link_local "Link to this definition")
    
These attributes are true for the network as a whole if they are true for both the network address and the broadcast address. 

network_address[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.network_address "Link to this definition")
    
The network address for the network. The network address and the prefix length together uniquely define a network. 

broadcast_address[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.broadcast_address "Link to this definition")
    
The broadcast address for the network. Packets sent to the broadcast address should be received by every host on the network. 

hostmask[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.hostmask "Link to this definition")
    
The host mask, as an [`IPv4Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") object. 

netmask[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.netmask "Link to this definition")
    
The net mask, as an [`IPv4Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") object. 

with_prefixlen[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.with_prefixlen "Link to this definition")


compressed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.compressed "Link to this definition")


exploded[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.exploded "Link to this definition")
    
A string representation of the network, with the mask in prefix notation.
`with_prefixlen` and `compressed` are always the same as `str(network)`. `exploded` uses the exploded form the network address. 

with_netmask[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.with_netmask "Link to this definition")
    
A string representation of the network, with the mask in net mask notation. 

with_hostmask[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.with_hostmask "Link to this definition")
    
A string representation of the network, with the mask in host mask notation. 

num_addresses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.num_addresses "Link to this definition")
    
The total number of addresses in the network. 

prefixlen[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.prefixlen "Link to this definition")
    
Length of the network prefix, in bits. 

hosts()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network.hosts "Link to this definition")
    
Returns an iterator over the usable hosts in the network. The usable hosts are all the IP addresses that belong to the network, except the network address itself and the network broadcast address. For networks with a mask length of 31, the network address and network broadcast address are also included in the result. Networks with a mask of 32 will return a list containing the single host address.
>>>```
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.0/29').hosts())
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.1'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.2'),
 IPv4Address('192.0.2.3'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.4'),
 IPv4Address('192.0.2.5'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.6')]
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.0/31').hosts())
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.0'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.1')]
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.1/32').hosts())
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.1')]

Title: SQLite3 Library: Deprecation and Executing Scripts
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
Summary: This section notes that any resulting rows from certain DML statements are discarded and highlights the deprecation of using named placeholders with sequences in parameters, which will lead to a ProgrammingError starting in Python 3.14. It also describes the `executescript` method for executing SQL statements from a provided script.

```

Note
Any resulting rows are discarded, including DML statements with [RETURNING clauses](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_returning.html).
Deprecated since version 3.12, will be removed in version 3.14: [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") is emitted if [named placeholders](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-placeholders) are used and the items in _parameters_ are sequences instead of [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict")s. Starting with Python 3.14, [`ProgrammingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.ProgrammingError "sqlite3.ProgrammingError") will be raised instead. 

executescript(_sql_script_ , _/_)[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.executescript "Link to this definition")
    
Execute the SQL statements in _sql_script_. If the [`autocommit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.autocommit "sqlite3.Connection.autocommit") is [`LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL "sqlite3.LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL") and there is a pending transaction, an implicit `COMMIT` statement is executed first. No other implicit transaction control is performed; any transaction control must be added to _sql_script_.
_sql_script_ must be a [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str").
Example:
```
# cur is an sqlite3.Cursor object
cur.executescript("""
  BEGIN;
  CREATE TABLE person(firstname, lastname, age);
  CREATE TABLE book(title, author, published);
  CREATE TABLE publisher(name, address);
  COMMIT;
""")

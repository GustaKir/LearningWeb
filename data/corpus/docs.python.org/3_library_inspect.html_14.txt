Title: Inspect Module: Annotations and FrameInfo
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html
Summary: This section discusses the best practice of using `get_annotations` to access the annotations dictionary of objects, and refers to the annotations best practices documentation. It also introduces the `FrameInfo` objects returned by certain functions, mentioning their deprecated tuple-like behavior for compatibility.
---

Calling `get_annotations` is best practice for accessing the annotations dict of any object. See [Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto) for more information on annotations best practices.
Added in version 3.10.
## The interpreter stack[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#the-interpreter-stack "Link to this heading")
Some of the following functions return [`FrameInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo "inspect.FrameInfo") objects. For backwards compatibility these objects allow tuple-like operations on all attributes except `positions`. This behavior is considered deprecated and may be removed in the future. 

_class_ inspect.FrameInfo[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo "Link to this definition")
     

frame[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.frame "Link to this definition")
    
The [frame object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) that the record corresponds to. 

filename[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.filename "Link to this definition")
    
The file name associated with the code being executed by the frame this record corresponds to. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number of the current line associated with the code being executed by the frame this record corresponds to. 

function[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.function "Link to this definition")
    
The function name that is being executed by the frame this record corresponds to. 

code_context[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.code_context "Link to this definition")
    
A list of lines of context from the source code that’s being executed by the frame this record corresponds to. 

index[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.index "Link to this definition")
    
The index of the current line being executed in the [`code_context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.code_context "inspect.FrameInfo.code_context") list. 

positions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.FrameInfo.positions "Link to this definition")
    
A [`dis.Positions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#dis.Positions "dis.Positions") object containing the start line number, end line number, start column offset, and end column offset associated with the instruction being executed by the frame this record corresponds to.
Changed in version 3.5: Return a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) instead of a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple").
Changed in version 3.11: `FrameInfo` is now a class instance (that is backwards compatible with the previous [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple)). 

_class_ inspect.Traceback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback "Link to this definition")
     

filename[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.filename "Link to this definition")
    
The file name associated with the code being executed by the frame this traceback corresponds to. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number of the current line associated with the code being executed by the frame this traceback corresponds to. 

function[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.function "Link to this definition")
    
The function name that is being executed by the frame this traceback corresponds to. 

code_context[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.code_context "Link to this definition")
    
A list of lines of context from the source code that’s being executed by the frame this traceback corresponds to. 

index[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.index "Link to this definition")
    
The index of the current line being executed in the [`code_context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Traceback.code_context "inspect.Traceback.code_context") list.

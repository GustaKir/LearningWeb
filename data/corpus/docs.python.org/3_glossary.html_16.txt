Title: Glossary of Python Terms
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
Summary: This section defines key Python concepts including Method Resolution Order, which dictates the base class search order during member lookup, and modules, which are organizational units of Python code that contain namespaces with various Python objects. It also introduces 'module spec', which holds import-related information for loading modules.

method resolution order[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order "Link to this term")
    
Method Resolution Order is the order in which base classes are searched for a member during lookup. See [The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/mro.html#python-2-3-mro) for details of the algorithm used by the Python interpreter since the 2.3 release. 

module[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module "Link to this term")
    
An object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code. Modules have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects. Modules are loaded into Python by the process of [importing](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importing).
See also [package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package). 

module spec[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module-spec "Link to this term")
    
A namespace containing the import-related information used to load a module. An instance of [`importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec").
See also [Module specs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#module-specs). 

MRO[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-MRO "Link to this term")
    
See [method resolution order](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order). 

mutable[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable "Link to this term")
    
Mutable objects can change their value but keep their [`id()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id "id"). See also [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable). 

named tuple[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple "Link to this term")
    
The term “named tuple” applies to any type or class that inherits from tuple and whose indexable elements are also accessible using named attributes. The type or class may have other features as well.
Several built-in types are named tuples, including the values returned by [`time.localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime") and [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat"). Another example is [`sys.float_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info "sys.float_info"):
>>>```
>>> sys.float_info[1]          # indexed access
1024
>>> sys.float_info.max_exp       # named field access
1024
>>> isinstance(sys.float_info, tuple)  # kind of tuple
True

Title: Improvements to time.sleep() in Python 3.11
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html
Summary: Python 3.11 enhances the `time.sleep()` function. On Unix, it now utilizes `clock_nanosleep()` or `nanosleep()`, achieving a resolution of 1 nanosecond compared to the previous 1 microsecond. On Windows 8.1 and newer, it employs a waitable timer for high-resolution timing, with a 100 nanosecond resolution, improving from the previous 1 millisecond timing.

### time[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#time "Link to this heading")
  * On Unix, [`time.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep "time.sleep") now uses the `clock_nanosleep()` or `nanosleep()` function, if available, which has a resolution of 1 nanosecond (10-9 seconds), rather than using `select()` which has a resolution of 1 microsecond (10-6 seconds).

  * On Windows 8.1 and newer, [`time.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep "time.sleep") now uses a waitable timer based on [high-resolution timers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/high-resolution-timers) which has a resolution of 100 nanoseconds (10-7 seconds). Previously, it had a resolution of 1 millisecond (10-3 seconds).

### tkinter[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#tkinter "Link to this heading")
  * Added method `info_patchlevel()` which returns the exact version of the Tcl library as a named tuple similar to [`sys.version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info "sys.version_info").

### traceback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#traceback "Link to this heading")
  * Add [`traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary "traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary") to allow users to override which frames appear in the traceback, and how they are formatted. (Contributed by Ammar Askar in [bpo-44569](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44569).)
  * Add [`traceback.TracebackException.print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.print "traceback.TracebackException.print"), which prints the formatted [`TracebackException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException "traceback.TracebackException") instance to a file.

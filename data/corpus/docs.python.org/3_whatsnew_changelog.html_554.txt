Title: Python Build System Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Recent changes to Python's build system include improved detection of the C compiler environment variables, removal of the –without-gcc and –with-icc options, enabling verbose builds with macros for extension modules, and updates to configuration files. Additionally, new triplets for specific architectures have been added, and a change in module building behavior regarding the preprocessor definition Py_BUILD_CORE has been implemented.

-33483](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33483): C compiler is now correctly detected from the standard environment variables. –without-gcc and –with-icc options have been removed.
  * [bpo-33394](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33394): Enable the verbose build for extension modules, when GNU make is passed macros on the command line.
  * [bpo-33393](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33393): Update config.guess and config.sub files.
  * [bpo-33377](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33377): Add new triplets for mips r6 and riscv variants (used in extension suffixes).
  * [bpo-32232](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32232): By default, modules configured in `Modules/Setup` are no longer built with `-DPy_BUILD_CORE`. Instead, modules that specifically need that preprocessor definition include it in their individual entries.
  * [bpo-33182](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33182): The embedding tests can once again be built with clang 6.0
  * [bpo-33163](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33163): Upgrade pip to 9.0.3 and setuptools to v39.0.1.
  * [bpo-33012](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33012): gcc 8 has added a new warning heuristic to detect invalid function casts and a stock python build seems to hit that warning quite often. The most common is the cast of a METH_NOARGS function (that uses just one argument) to a PyCFunction. Fix this by adding a dummy argument to all functions that implement METH_NOARGS.
  * [bpo-32898](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32898): Fix the python debug build when using COUNT_ALLOCS.
  * [bpo-29442](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29442): Replace optparse with argparse in setup.py

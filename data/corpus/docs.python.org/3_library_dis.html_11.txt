Title: Python Disassembly Opcodes: Collection Building
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html
Summary: This section describes several Python bytecode opcodes related to building collection objects, including BUILD_LIST, BUILD_SET, BUILD_MAP, and BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP. Each opcode facilitates the creation of a specific collection type, such as lists, sets, and dictionaries, with details on their functionality and usage.

BUILD_LIST(_count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_LIST "Link to this definition")
    
Works as [`BUILD_TUPLE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_TUPLE), but creates a list. 

BUILD_SET(_count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_SET "Link to this definition")
    
Works as [`BUILD_TUPLE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_TUPLE), but creates a set. 

BUILD_MAP(_count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_MAP "Link to this definition")
    
Pushes a new dictionary object onto the stack. Pops `2 * count` items so that the dictionary holds _count_ entries: `{..., STACK[-4]: STACK[-3], STACK[-2]: STACK[-1]}`.
Changed in version 3.5: The dictionary is created from stack items instead of creating an empty dictionary pre-sized to hold _count_ items. 

BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP(_count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP "Link to this definition")
    
The version of [`BUILD_MAP`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_MAP) specialized for constant keys. Pops the top element on the stack which contains a tuple of keys, then starting from `STACK[-2]`, pops _count_ values to form values in the built dictionary.
Added in version 3.6. 

BUILD_STRING(_count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_STRING "Link to this definition")
    
Concatenates _count_ strings from the stack and pushes the resulting string onto the stack.
Added in version 3.6. 

LIST_EXTEND(_i_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-LIST_EXTEND "Link to this definition")
    
Implements:
```
seq = STACK.pop()
list.extend(STACK[-i], seq)

```

Used to build lists.
Added in version 3.9. 

SET_UPDATE(_i_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-SET_UPDATE "Link to this definition")
    
Implements:
```
seq = STACK.pop()
set.update(STACK[-i], seq)

```

Used to build sets.
Added in version 3.9. 

DICT_UPDATE(_i_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-DICT_UPDATE "Link to this definition")
    
Implements:
```
map = STACK.pop()
dict.update(STACK[-i], map)

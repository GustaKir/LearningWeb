Title: Memory Allocation Statistics in tracemalloc
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html
Summary: The document outlines the 'Statistic' class in the tracemalloc module, detailing three key attributes: 'count' (number of memory blocks), 'size' (total size of memory blocks in bytes), and 'traceback' (traceback where the memory block was allocated). It also introduces the 'StatisticDiff' class, which provides a difference in memory allocations between snapshots.
---

count[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Statistic.count "Link to this definition")
    
Number of memory blocks (`int`). 

size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Statistic.size "Link to this definition")
    
Total size of memory blocks in bytes (`int`). 

traceback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Statistic.traceback "Link to this definition")
    
Traceback where the memory block was allocated, [`Traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Traceback "tracemalloc.Traceback") instance.
### StatisticDiff[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#statisticdiff "Link to this heading") 

_class_ tracemalloc.StatisticDiff[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff "Link to this definition")
    
Statistic difference on memory allocations between an old and a new [`Snapshot`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Snapshot "tracemalloc.Snapshot") instance.
[`Snapshot.compare_to()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Snapshot.compare_to "tracemalloc.Snapshot.compare_to") returns a list of [`StatisticDiff`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff "tracemalloc.StatisticDiff") instances. See also the [`Statistic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Statistic "tracemalloc.Statistic") class. 

count[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff.count "Link to this definition")
    
Number of memory blocks in the new snapshot (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been released in the new snapshot. 

count_diff[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff.count_diff "Link to this definition")
    
Difference of number of memory blocks between the old and the new snapshots (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been allocated in the new snapshot. 

size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff.size "Link to this definition")
    
Total size of memory blocks in bytes in the new snapshot (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been released in the new snapshot. 

size_diff[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff.size_diff "Link to this definition")
    
Difference of total size of memory blocks in bytes between the old and the new snapshots (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been allocated in the new snapshot. 

traceback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.StatisticDiff.traceback "Link to this definition")
    
Traceback where the memory blocks were allocated, [`Traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Traceback "tracemalloc.Traceback") instance.
### Trace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#trace "Link to this heading") 

_class_ tracemalloc.Trace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace "Link to this definition")
    
Trace of a memory block.
The [`Snapshot.traces`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Snapshot.traces "tracemalloc.Snapshot.traces") attribute is a sequence of [`Trace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace "tracemalloc.Trace") instances.
Changed in version 3.6: Added the [`domain`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace.domain "tracemalloc.Trace.domain") attribute. 

domain[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace.domain "Link to this definition")
    
Address space of a memory block (`int`). Read-only property.
tracemalloc uses the domain `0` to trace memory allocations made by Python. C extensions can use other domains to trace other resources. 

size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace.size "Link to this definition")
    
Size of the memory block in bytes (`int`). 

traceback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Trace.traceback "Link to this definition")
    
Traceback where the memory block was allocated, [`Traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Traceback "tracemalloc.Traceback") instance.

Title: BaseCookie.load Method and Morsel Objects
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html
Summary: The BaseCookie.load method parses a string as an HTTP_COOKIE or accepts a dictionary to add Morsel objects, representing key/value pairs with RFC 2109 attributes. Morsel objects are dictionary-like with a constant set of valid keys defined by RFC 2109.

BaseCookie.load(_rawdata_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.BaseCookie.load "Link to this definition")
    
If _rawdata_ is a string, parse it as an `HTTP_COOKIE` and add the values found there as [`Morsel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel "http.cookies.Morsel")s. If it is a dictionary, it is equivalent to:
```
for k, v in rawdata.items():
  cookie[k] = v

```

## Morsel Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#morsel-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ http.cookies.Morsel[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel "Link to this definition")
    
Abstract a key/value pair, which has some [**RFC 2109**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109.html) attributes.
Morsels are dictionary-like objects, whose set of keys is constant — the valid [**RFC 2109**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109.html) attributes, which are:

samesite[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.samesite "Link to this definition")

The attribute [`httponly`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.httponly "http.cookies.Morsel.httponly") specifies that the cookie is only transferred in HTTP requests, and is not accessible through JavaScript. This is intended to mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting.
The attribute [`samesite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.samesite "http.cookies.Morsel.samesite") specifies that the browser is not allowed to send the cookie along with cross-site requests. This helps to mitigate CSRF attacks. Valid values for this attribute are “Strict” and “Lax”.
The keys are case-insensitive and their default value is `''`.
Changed in version 3.5: `__eq__()` now takes [`key`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.key "http.cookies.Morsel.key") and [`value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.value "http.cookies.Morsel.value") into account.
Changed in version 3.7: Attributes [`key`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.key "http.cookies.Morsel.key"), [`value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.value "http.cookies.Morsel.value") and [`coded_value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.coded_value "http.cookies.Morsel.coded_value") are read-only. Use [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.set "http.cookies.Morsel.set") for setting them.
Changed in version 3.8: Added support for the [`samesite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.samesite "http.cookies.Morsel.samesite") attribute. 

Morsel.value[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.value "Link to this definition")

Morsel.coded_value[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.coded_value "Link to this definition")

Set the _key_ , _value_ and _coded_value_ attributes. 

Morsel.isReservedKey(_K_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.isReservedKey "Link to this definition")
    
Whether _K_ is a member of the set of keys of a [`Morsel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel "http.cookies.Morsel").

Title: Struct Module Classes in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
Summary: The struct module defines the struct.Struct class, which allows efficient reading and writing of binary data according to a given format string. Creating a Struct object is more efficient than repeatedly calling module-level functions since it compiles the format string once. The module also caches compiled versions of recent format strings for performance.

## Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#classes "Link to this heading")
The [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#module-struct "struct: Interpret bytes as packed binary data.") module also defines the following type: 

_class_ struct.Struct(_format_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct "Link to this definition")
    
Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to the format string _format_. Creating a `Struct` object once and calling its methods is more efficient than calling module-level functions with the same format since the format string is only compiled once.
Note
The compiled versions of the most recent format strings passed to the module-level functions are cached, so programs that use only a few format strings needn’t worry about reusing a single [`Struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct "struct.Struct") instance.
Compiled Struct objects support the following methods and attributes: 

pack(_v1_ , _v2_ , _..._)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.pack "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to the [`pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack "struct.pack") function, using the compiled format. (`len(result)` will equal [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").) 

pack_into(_buffer_ , _offset_ , _v1_ , _v2_ , _..._)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.pack_into "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to the [`pack_into()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack_into "struct.pack_into") function, using the compiled format. 

unpack(_buffer_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.unpack "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to the [`unpack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.unpack "struct.unpack") function, using the compiled format. The buffer’s size in bytes must equal [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size"). 

unpack_from(_buffer_ , _offset =0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.unpack_from "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to the [`unpack_from()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.unpack_from "struct.unpack_from") function, using the compiled format. The buffer’s size in bytes, starting at position _offset_ , must be at least [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size"). 

iter_unpack(_buffer_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.iter_unpack "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to the [`iter_unpack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.iter_unpack "struct.iter_unpack") function, using the compiled format. The buffer’s size in bytes must be a multiple of [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").
Added in version 3.4. 

format[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.format "Link to this definition")
    
The format string used to construct this Struct object.
Changed in version 3.7: The format string type is now [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") instead of [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"). 

size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "Link to this definition")
    
The calculated size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by the [`pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack "struct.pack") method) corresponding to [`format`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format").
Changed in version 3.13: The _repr()_ of structs has changed. It is now:
>>>```
>>> Struct('i')
Struct('i')

Title: __builtins__ in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html
Summary: This section explains that `__builtins__` is made available in most modules as part of their globals, usually referencing the module itself or its `__dict__` attribute. It notes that this feature is an implementation detail and may not be applicable in all Python implementations. Additional resources on built-in constants, exceptions, functions, and types are also provided.

```

As an implementation detail, most modules have the name `__builtins__` made available as part of their globals. The value of `__builtins__` is normally either this module or the value of this module’s [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python.

Title: New sysconfig Module in Python 3.1
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html
Summary: The 'sysconfig' module has been separated from Distutils and now serves as a standalone module in Python 3.1. It offers functionalities to retrieve information about Python's build process, including compiler settings and installation paths.

```

[`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.") was implemented by Brett Cannon and introduced in Python 3.1.
### New module: sysconfig[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#new-module-sysconfig "Link to this heading")
The [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") module has been pulled out of the Distutils package, becoming a new top-level module in its own right. [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") provides functions for getting information about Python’s build process: compiler switches, installation paths, the platform name, and whether Python is running from its source directory.
Some of the functions in the module are:
  * [`get_config_var()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_config_var "sysconfig.get_config_var") returns variables from Python’s Makefile and the `pyconfig.h` file.
  * [`get_config_vars()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_config_vars "sysconfig.get_config_vars") returns a dictionary containing all of the configuration variables.
  * [`get_path()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_path "sysconfig.get_path") returns the configured path for a particular type of module: the standard library, site-specific modules, platform-specific modules, etc.
  * [`is_python_build()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.is_python_build "sysconfig.is_python_build") returns true if you’re running a binary from a Python source tree, and false otherwise.


Consult the [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") documentation for more details and for a complete list of functions.
The Distutils package and [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") are now maintained by Tarek Ziadé, who has also started a Distutils2 package (source repository at <https://hg.python.org/distutils2/>) for developing a next-generation version of Distutils.
### ttk: Themed Widgets for Tk[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#ttk-themed-widgets-for-tk "Link to this heading")
Tcl/Tk 8.5 includes a set of themed widgets that re-implement basic Tk widgets but have a more customizable appearance and can therefore more closely resemble the native platform’s widgets. This widget set was originally called Tile, but was renamed to Ttk (for “themed Tk”) on being added to Tcl/Tck release 8.5.
To learn more, read the [`ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set") module documentation. You may also wish to read the Tcl/Tk manual page describing the Ttk theme engine, available at <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/ttk_intro.html>. Some screenshots of the Python/Ttk code in use are at <https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-ttk/wikis/Screenshots.wiki>.
The [`tkinter.ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set") module was written by Guilherme Polo and added in [bpo-2983](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=2983). An alternate version called `Tile.py`, written by Martin Franklin and maintained by Kevin Walzer, was proposed for inclusion in [bpo-2618](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=2618), but the authors argued that Guilherme Polo’s work was more comprehensive.
### Updated module: unittest[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#updated-module-unittest "Link to this heading")
The [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") module was greatly enhanced; many new features were added. Most of these features were implemented by Michael Foord, unless otherwise noted. The enhanced version of the module is downloadable separately for use with Python versions 2.4 to 2.6, packaged as the `unittest2` package, from [unittest2](https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/).
When used from the command line, the module can automatically discover tests. It’s not as fancy as [py.test](https://pytest.org) or [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/), but provides a simple way to run tests kept within a set of package directories. For example, the following command will search the `test/` subdirectory for any importable test files named `test*.py`:
```
python -m unittest discover -s test

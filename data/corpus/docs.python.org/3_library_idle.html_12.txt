Title: Setting Preferences in IDLE
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html
Summary: Users can customize font, highlighting, keys, and general preferences in IDLE through the Configure IDLE dialog in the Options menu. Non-default settings are saved in the `.idlerc` directory. To resolve issues with bad configurations, users can edit or delete the corresponding files. The Font tab allows for font customization, while the Highlights and Keys tab enables theme and key set selection.

### Setting preferences[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#setting-preferences "Link to this heading")
The font preferences, highlighting, keys, and general preferences can be changed via Configure IDLE on the Option menu. Non-default user settings are saved in a `.idlerc` directory in the user’s home directory. Problems caused by bad user configuration files are solved by editing or deleting one or more of the files in `.idlerc`.
On the Font tab, see the text sample for the effect of font face and size on multiple characters in multiple languages. Edit the sample to add other characters of personal interest. Use the sample to select monospaced fonts. If particular characters have problems in Shell or an editor, add them to the top of the sample and try changing first size and then font.
On the Highlights and Keys tab, select a built-in or custom color theme and key set. To use a newer built-in color theme or key set with older IDLEs, save it as a new custom theme or key set and it well be accessible to older IDLEs.
### IDLE on macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#idle-on-macos "Link to this heading")
Under System Preferences: Dock, one can set “Prefer tabs when opening documents” to “Always”. This setting is not compatible with the tk/tkinter GUI framework used by IDLE, and it breaks a few IDLE features.
### Extensions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#extensions "Link to this heading")
IDLE contains an extension facility. Preferences for extensions can be changed with the Extensions tab of the preferences dialog. See the beginning of config-extensions.def in the idlelib directory for further information. The only current default extension is zzdummy, an example also used for testing.
## idlelib — implementation of IDLE application[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#module-idlelib "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/idlelib](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/idlelib)
The Lib/idlelib package implements the IDLE application. See the rest of this page for how to use IDLE.
The files in idlelib are described in idlelib/README.txt. Access it either in idlelib or click Help => About IDLE on the IDLE menu. This file also maps IDLE menu items to the code that implements the item.

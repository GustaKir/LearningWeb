Title: Changelog for Idle Library Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section outlines several bug reports (bpo) related to the Idle library, including changes such as the replacement of help.txt with help.html for better documentation presentation, deprecation of the unused idlever module, and the removal of extraneous code that causes conflicts. Additionally, synchronization comments have been added for future maintainers.
---

.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24861): Most of idlelib is private and subject to change. Use idleib.idle.* to start Idle. See idlelib.__init__.__doc__.
  * [bpo-25199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25199): Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.
  * [bpo-16893](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16893): Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman. The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are deprecated.
  * [bpo-24199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24199): Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.
  * [bpo-24790](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24790): Remove extraneous code (which also create 2 & 3 conflicts).

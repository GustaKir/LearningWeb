Title: Python IDLE Updates and Fixes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section details several bug fixes and improvements in Python's IDLE, including resolving unresponsiveness issues, enhancements in test consistency, and updates to menu definitions and naming conventions.
---

(https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34120): Fix unresponsiveness after closing certain windows and dialogs.
  * [bpo-33975](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33975): Avoid small type when running htests. Since part of the purpose of human-viewed tests is to determine that widgets look right, it is important that they look the same for testing as when running IDLE.
  * [bpo-33905](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33905): Add test for idlelib.stackview.StackBrowser.
  * [bpo-33924](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33924): Change mainmenu.menudefs key ‘windows’ to ‘window’. Every other menudef key is lowercase version of main menu entry.
  * [bpo-33906](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33906): Rename idlelib.windows as window Match Window on the main menu and remove last plural module name.
  * [bpo-33917](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33917): Fix and document idlelib/idle_test/template.py. The revised file compiles, runs, and tests OK. idle_test/README.txt explains how to use it to create new IDLE test files.
  * [bpo-33904](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33904): IDLE: In rstrip, rename class RstripExtension as Rstrip
  * [bpo-33907](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33907): For consistency and clarity, rename an IDLE module and classes. Module calltips and its class CallTips are now calltip and Calltip. In module calltip_w, class CallTip is now CalltipWindow.
  * [bpo-33856](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33856): Add “help” in the welcome message of IDLE
  * [bpo-33839](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33839): IDLE: refactor ToolTip and CallTip and add documentation and tests
  * [bpo-33855](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33855): Minimally test all IDLE modules. Add missing files, import module, instantiate classes, and check coverage. Check existing files.
  * [bpo-33656](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33656): On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales for DPI. On Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python binary unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this should make text and lines sharper. It should otherwise have no effect.
  * [bpo-33768](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33768): Clicking on a context line moves that line to the top of the editor window.
  * [bpo-33763](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33763): IDLE: Use read-only text widget for code context instead of label widget.
  * [bpo-33664](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33664): Scroll IDLE editor text by lines. Previously, the mouse wheel and scrollbar slider moved text by a fixed number of pixels, resulting in partial lines at the top of the editor box. The change also applies to the shell and grep output windows, but not to read-only text views.
  * [bpo-33679](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33679): Enable theme-specific color configuration for Code Context. Use the Highlights tab to see the setting for built-in themes or add settings to custom themes.
  * [bpo-33642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33642): Display up to maxlines non-blank lines for Code Context. If there is no current context, show a single blank line.
  * [bpo-33628](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33628): IDLE: Cleanup codecontext.py and its test.
  * [bpo-33564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33564): IDLE’s code context now recognizes async as a block opener.
  * [bpo-21474](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21474): Update word/identifier definition from ascii to unicode. In text and entry boxes, this affects selection by double-click, movement left/right by control-left/right, and deletion left/right by control-BACKSPACE/DEL.
  * [bpo-33204](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33204): IDLE: consistently color invalid string prefixes. A ‘u’ string prefix cannot be paired with either ‘r’ or ‘f’. Consistently color as much of the prefix, starting at the right, as is valid. Revise and extend colorizer test.
  * [bpo-32984](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32984): Set `__file__` while running a startup file. Like Python, IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before presenting the first interactive input prompt. For IDLE, `-s` runs a file named in environmental variable `IDLESTARTUP` or [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP); `-r file` runs `file`. Python sets `__file__` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets it before the first prompt.

Title: Python Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: The 'disable_check' argument default changes to 'False'; bugs fixed in the 'inspect' and 'typing' modules, addressing signature inconsistencies and a regression with class type checking.
---

The default for the “disable_check” argument has change from `True` to `False`, to better match the new function name.
  * [gh-105080](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105080): Fixed inconsistent signature on derived classes for [`inspect.signature()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature "inspect.signature")
  * [gh-105144](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105144): Fix a recent regression in the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\).") module. The regression meant that doing `class Foo(X, typing.Protocol)`, where `X` was a class that had [`abc.ABCMeta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABCMeta "abc.ABCMeta") as its metaclass, would then cause subsequent `isinstance(1, X)` calls to erroneously raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). Patch by Alex Waygood.
  * [gh-62948](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/62948): The [`io.IOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase "io.IOBase") finalizer now logs the `close()` method errors with [`sys.unraisablehook`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.unraisablehook "sys.unraisablehook"). Previously, errors were ignored silently by default, and only logged in [Python Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) or on [Python built on debug mode](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-105096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105096): [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."): Deprecate the `getmark()`, `setmark()` and `getmarkers()` methods of the [`wave.Wave_read`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read "wave.Wave_read") and [`wave.Wave_write`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write "wave.Wave_write") classes. They will be removed in Python 3.15. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-104992](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104992): Remove the untested and undocumented `unittest.TestProgram.usageExit()` method, deprecated in Python 3.11. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
  * [gh-104996](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104996): Improve performance of [`pathlib.PurePath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath") initialisation by deferring joining of paths when multiple arguments are given.
  * [gh-101588](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101588): Deprecate undocumented copy/deepcopy/pickle support for itertools.
  * [gh-103631](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103631): Fix `pathlib.PurePosixPath(pathlib.PureWindowsPath(...))` not converting path separators to restore 3.11 compatible behavior.
  * [gh-104947](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104947): Make comparisons between [`pathlib.PureWindowsPath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PureWindowsPath "pathlib.PureWindowsPath") objects consistent across Windows and Posix to match 3.11 behavior.
  * [gh-104773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104773): [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/): Remove the `audioop` module, deprecated in Python 3.11. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-104773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104773): [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/): Remove the `aifc` module, deprecated in Python 3.11. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-104773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104773): [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/): Remove the `uu` module, deprecated in Python 3.11. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-104935](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104935): Fix bugs with the interaction between [`typing.runtime_checkable()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.runtime_checkable "typing.runtime_checkable") and [`typing.Generic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") that were introduced by the [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) implementation. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [gh-104773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104773): [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/): Remove the `crypt` module and its private `_crypt` extension, deprecated in Python 3.11. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-104773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104773): [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/): Remove the `nis` module, deprecated in Python 3.11.

See PEP 695.
  * [gh-62519](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/62519): Make [`gettext.pgettext()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#gettext.pgettext "gettext.pgettext") search plural definitions when translation is not found.
  * [gh-107089](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107089): Shelves opened with [`shelve.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html#shelve.open "shelve.open") have a much faster `clear()` method. Patch by James Cave.
  * [gh-82500](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82500): Fix overflow on 32-bit systems with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") [`os.sendfile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sendfile "os.sendfile") implementation.
  * [gh-83006](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83006): Document behavior of [`shutil.disk_usage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.disk_usage "shutil.disk_usage") for non-mounted filesystems on Unix.
  * [gh-65495](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/65495): Use lowercase `mail from` and `rcpt to` in `smptlib.SMTP`.
  * [gh-106186](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106186): Do not report `MultipartInvariantViolationDefect` defect when the [`email.parser.Parser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.parser.html#email.parser.Parser "email.parser.Parser") class is used to parse emails with `headersonly=True`.
  * [gh-105002](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105002): Fix invalid result from `PurePath.relative_to()` method when attempting to walk a “`..`” segment in _other_ with _walk_up_ enabled. A [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") exception is now raised in this case.
  * [gh-106739](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106739): Add the `rtype_cache` to the warning message (as an addition to the type of leaked objects and the number of leaked objects already included in the message) to make debugging leaked objects easier when the multiprocessing resource tracker process finds leaked objects at shutdown. This helps more quickly identify what was leaked and/or why the leaked object was not properly cleaned up.
  * [gh-106751](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106751): Optimize `SelectSelector.select()` for many iteration case. Patch By Donghee Na.
  * [gh-106751](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106751): Optimize `_PollLikeSelector.select()` for many iteration case.
  * [gh-106751](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106751): Optimize `KqueueSelector.select()` for many iteration case.

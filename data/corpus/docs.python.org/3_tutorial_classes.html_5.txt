Title: Understanding Methods in Python Classes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
Summary: This section explains that methods are functions associated with objects in Python. It clarifies that method names depend on the object's class and introduces the concept of method objects, highlighting the difference between method objects and function objects. It also illustrates how a method can be stored and called later rather than immediately.

The other kind of instance attribute reference is a _method_. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object.
Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, `x.f` is a valid method reference, since `MyClass.f` is a function, but `x.i` is not, since `MyClass.i` is not. But `x.f` is not the same thing as `MyClass.f` — it is a _method object_ , not a function object.
### 9.3.4. Method Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects "Link to this heading")
Usually, a method is called right after it is bound:
```
x.f()

```

In the `MyClass` example, this will return the string `'hello world'`. However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: `x.f` is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:
```
xf = x.f
while True:
  print(xf())

```

will continue to print `hello world` until the end of time.
What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that `x.f()` was called without an argument above, even though the function definition for `f()` specified an argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually used…
Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call `x.f()` is exactly equivalent to `MyClass.f(x)`. In general, calling a method with a list of _n_ arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the first argument.
In general, methods work as follows. When a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, references to both the instance object and the function object are packed into a method object. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.
### 9.3.5. Class and Instance Variables[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables "Link to this heading")
Generally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:
```
classDog:
  kind = 'canine'     # class variable shared by all instances
  def__init__(self, name):
    self.name = name  # instance variable unique to each instance
>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.kind         # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> e.kind         # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> d.name         # unique to d
'Fido'
>>> e.name         # unique to e
'Buddy'

```

As discussed in [A Word About Names and Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-object), shared data can have possibly surprising effects with involving [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable) objects such as lists and dictionaries. For example, the _tricks_ list in the following code should not be used as a class variable because just a single list would be shared by all _Dog_ instances:
```
classDog:
  tricks = []       # mistaken use of a class variable
  def__init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
  defadd_trick(self, trick):
    self.tricks.append(trick)
>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks        # unexpectedly shared by all dogs
['roll over', 'play dead']

```

Correct design of the class should use an instance variable instead:
```
classDog:
  def__init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.tricks = []  # creates a new empty list for each dog
  defadd_trick(self, trick):
    self.tricks.append(trick)
>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks
['roll over']
>>> e.tricks
['play dead']

```

## 9.4. Random Remarks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#random-remarks "Link to this heading")
If the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class, then attribute lookup prioritizes the instance:
>>>```
>>> classWarehouse:
...   purpose = 'storage'
...   region = 'west'
...
>>> w1 = Warehouse()
>>> print(w1.purpose, w1.region)
storage west
>>> w2 = Warehouse()
>>> w2.region = 'east'
>>> print(w2.purpose, w2.region)
storage east

Title: Build Changes in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section details various build-related changes in Python, including the introduction of a standard autoconf macro for PKG_CONFIG, adjustments to the ssl module, and the removal of support for outdated compilers such as Borland C and MS-DOS. Additionally, it notes improvements in setup.py to handle empty extensions.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id794 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-15506](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15506): Use standard PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG autoconf macro in the configure script.
  * [bpo-22935](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22935): Allow the ssl module to be compiled if openssl doesn’t support SSL 3.
  * [bpo-22592](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22592): Drop support of the Borland C compiler to build Python. The distutils module still supports it to build extensions.
  * [bpo-22591](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22591): Drop support of MS-DOS, especially of the DJGPP compiler (MS-DOS port of GCC).
  * [bpo-16537](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16537): Check whether self.extensions is empty in setup.py. Patch by Jonathan Hosmer.
  * [bpo-22359](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22359): Remove incorrect uses of recursive make. Patch by Jonas Wagner.
  * [bpo-21958](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21958): Define HAVE_ROUND when building with Visual Studio 2013 and above. Patch by Zachary Turner.
  * [bpo-18093](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18093): the programs that embed the CPython runtime are now in a separate “Programs” directory, rather than being kept in the Modules directory.
  * [bpo-15759](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15759): “make suspicious”, “make linkcheck” and “make doctest” in Doc/ now display special message when and only when there are failures.
  * [bpo-21141](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21141): The Windows build process no longer attempts to find Perl, instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build. The `PCbuild\build_ssl.py` script has been re-written and re-named to `PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py`, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source for both 32 and 64 bit platforms. OpenSSL sources obtained from svn.python.org will always be pre-configured and ready to build.
  * [bpo-21037](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21037): Add a build option to enable AddressSanitizer support.
  * [bpo-19962](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19962): The Windows build process now creates “python.bat” in the root of the source tree, which passes all arguments through to the most recently built interpreter.
  * [bpo-21285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21285): Refactor and fix curses configure check to always search in a ncursesw directory.
  * [bpo-15234](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15234): For BerkeleyDB and Sqlite, only add the found library and include directories if they aren’t already being searched. This avoids an explicit runtime library dependency.
  * [bpo-17861](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17861): Tools/scripts/generate_opcode_h.py automatically regenerates Include/opcode.h from Lib/opcode.py if the latter gets any change.
  * [bpo-20644](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20644): OS X installer build support for documentation build changes in 3.4.1: assume externally supplied sphinx-build is available in /usr/bin.
  * [bpo-20022](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20022): Eliminate use of deprecated bundlebuilder in OS X builds.
  * [bpo-15968](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15968): Incorporated Tcl, Tk, and Tix builds into the Windows build solution.
  * [bpo-17095](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17095): Fix Modules/Setup _shared_ support.
  * [bpo-21811](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21811): Anticipated fixes to support OS X versions > 10.9.
  * [bpo-21166](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21166): Prevent possible segfaults and other random failures of python –generate-posix-vars in pybuilddir.txt build target.
  * [bpo-18096](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18096): Fix library order returned by python-config.
  * [bpo-17219](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17219): Add library build dir for Python extension cross-builds.
  * [bpo-22919](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22919): Windows build updated to support VC 14.0 (Visual Studio 2015), which will be used for the official release.
  * [bpo-21236](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21236): Build _msi.pyd with cabinet.lib instead of fci.lib
  * [bpo-17128](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17128): Use private version of OpenSSL for OS X 10.5+ installer.

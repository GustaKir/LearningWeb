Title: Tkinter Ttk Notebook Methods
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html
Summary: This section details several methods of the Tkinter Ttk Notebook widget including 'hide' to conceal a specified tab, 'identify' to get the tab name at a given position, 'index' to retrieve the numeric index of a tab, and 'insert' for adding a tab at a specific position.
---

hide(_tab_id_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.hide "Link to this definition")
    
Hides the tab specified by _tab_id_.
The tab will not be displayed, but the associated window remains managed by the notebook and its configuration remembered. Hidden tabs may be restored with the [`add()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.add "tkinter.ttk.Notebook.add") command. 

identify(_x_ , _y_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.identify "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the name of the tab element at position _x_ , _y_ , or the empty string if none. 

index(_tab_id_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.index "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the numeric index of the tab specified by _tab_id_ , or the total number of tabs if _tab_id_ is the string “end”. 

insert(_pos_ , _child_ , _** kw_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.insert "Link to this definition")
    
Inserts a pane at the specified position.
_pos_ is either the string “end”, an integer index, or the name of a managed child. If _child_ is already managed by the notebook, moves it to the specified position.
See [Tab Options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tab-options) for the list of available options. 

select(_tab_id =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.select "Link to this definition")
    
Selects the specified _tab_id_.
The associated child window will be displayed, and the previously selected window (if different) is unmapped. If _tab_id_ is omitted, returns the widget name of the currently selected pane. 

tab(_tab_id_ , _option =None_, _** kw_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.tab "Link to this definition")
    
Query or modify the options of the specific _tab_id_.
If _kw_ is not given, returns a dictionary of the tab option values. If _option_ is specified, returns the value of that _option_. Otherwise, sets the options to the corresponding values. 

tabs()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.tabs "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a list of windows managed by the notebook. 

enable_traversal()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Notebook.enable_traversal "Link to this definition")
    
Enable keyboard traversal for a toplevel window containing this notebook.
This will extend the bindings for the toplevel window containing the notebook as follows:
  * `Control`-`Tab`: selects the tab following the currently selected one.
  * `Shift`-`Control`-`Tab`: selects the tab preceding the currently selected one.
  * `Alt`-`K`: where _K_ is the mnemonic (underlined) character of any tab, will select that tab.


Multiple notebooks in a single toplevel may be enabled for traversal, including nested notebooks. However, notebook traversal only works properly if all panes have the notebook they are in as master.
## Progressbar[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#progressbar "Link to this heading")
The `ttk.Progressbar` widget shows the status of a long-running operation. It can operate in two modes: 1) the determinate mode which shows the amount completed relative to the total amount of work to be done and 2) the indeterminate mode which provides an animated display to let the user know that work is progressing.
### Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#id5 "Link to this heading")
This widget accepts the following specific options:
Option | Description  
---|---  
orient | One of “horizontal” or “vertical”. Specifies the orientation of the progress bar.  
length | Specifies the length of the long axis of the progress bar (width if horizontal, height if vertical).  
mode | One of “determinate” or “indeterminate”.  
maximum | A number specifying the maximum value. Defaults to 100.  
value | The current value of the progress bar. In “determinate” mode, this represents the amount of work completed. In “indeterminate” mode, it is interpreted as modulo _maximum_ ; that is, the progress bar completes one “cycle” when its value increases by _maximum_.  
variable | A name which is linked to the option value. If specified, the value of the progress bar is automatically set to the value of this name whenever the latter is modified.  
phase | Read-only option. The widget periodically increments the value of this option whenever its value is greater than 0 and, in determinate mode, less than maximum. This option may be used by the current theme to provide additional animation effects.

Title: os._exit() Function
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: The `os._exit(_n_)` function terminates the process immediately with a specified status code `_n_`, bypassing cleanup handlers and flushing stdio buffers. It is advised to use `sys.exit(n)` for normal exit conditions and to reserve `_exit()` for child processes after a `fork()`. Various exit codes are predefined for use but their availability may vary across Unix platforms.

os._exit(_n_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os._exit "Link to this definition")
    
Exit the process with status _n_ , without calling cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers, etc.
Note
The standard way to exit is [`sys.exit(n)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit"). `_exit()` should normally only be used in the child process after a [`fork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fork "os.fork").
The following exit codes are defined and can be used with [`_exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os._exit "os._exit"), although they are not required. These are typically used for system programs written in Python, such as a mail server’s external command delivery program.
Note
Some of these may not be available on all Unix platforms, since there is some variation. These constants are defined where they are defined by the underlying platform. 

os.EX_OK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.EX_OK "Link to this definition")

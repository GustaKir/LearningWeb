Title: Can I delete Python?
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/installed.html
Summary: The ability to delete Python depends on its installation source. If installed intentionally, it can be removed via the Control Panel on Windows. If it was installed by a third-party application, it's advised to use that application's uninstaller. Removing Python that comes with the operating system is not recommended, as it may affect tools reliant on Python.

## Can I delete Python?[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/installed.html#can-i-delete-python "Link to this heading")
That depends on where Python came from.
If someone installed it deliberately, you can remove it without hurting anything. On Windows, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel.
If Python was installed by a third-party application, you can also remove it, but that application will no longer work. You should use that application’s uninstaller rather than removing Python directly.
If Python came with your operating system, removing it is not recommended. If you remove it, whatever tools were written in Python will no longer run, and some of them might be important to you. Reinstalling the whole system would then be required to fix things again.

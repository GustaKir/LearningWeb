Title: mmap Module - rfind and seek Methods
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html
Summary: This document chunk describes the 'rfind' method, which returns the highest index of a subsequence within a specified range, returning -1 if not found, and discusses the 'seek' method for setting the current file position with optional whence parameters. Notable changes in versions 3.5 and 3.13 are also mentioned.

rfind(_sub_[, _start_[, _end_]])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.rfind "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the highest index in the object where the subsequence _sub_ is found, such that _sub_ is contained in the range [_start_ , _end_]. Optional arguments _start_ and _end_ are interpreted as in slice notation. Returns `-1` on failure.
Changed in version 3.5: Writable [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) is now accepted. 

seek(_pos_[, _whence_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.seek "Link to this definition")
    
Set the file’s current position. _whence_ argument is optional and defaults to `os.SEEK_SET` or `0` (absolute file positioning); other values are `os.SEEK_CUR` or `1` (seek relative to the current position) and `os.SEEK_END` or `2` (seek relative to the file’s end).
Changed in version 3.13: Return the new absolute position instead of `None`. 

seekable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.seekable "Link to this definition")
    
Return whether the file supports seeking, and the return value is always `True`.
Added in version 3.13. 

size()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.size "Link to this definition")
    
Return the length of the file, which can be larger than the size of the memory-mapped area. 

tell()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.tell "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the current position of the file pointer. 

write(_bytes_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.write "Link to this definition")
    
Write the bytes in _bytes_ into memory at the current position of the file pointer and return the number of bytes written (never less than `len(bytes)`, since if the write fails, a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") will be raised). The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were written. If the mmap was created with `ACCESS_READ`, then writing to it will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception.
Changed in version 3.5: Writable [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) is now accepted.
Changed in version 3.6: The number of bytes written is now returned. 

write_byte(_byte_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#mmap.mmap.write_byte "Link to this definition")
    
Write the integer _byte_ into memory at the current position of the file pointer; the file position is advanced by `1`. If the mmap was created with `ACCESS_READ`, then writing to it will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception.

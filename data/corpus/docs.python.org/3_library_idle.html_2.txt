Title: IDLE Editor Features: Editing and Navigation
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html
Summary: This section details various features of the IDLE editor, including clipboard operations, search functionalities, line navigation, and word completion options. Key functions include 'Find', 'Replace', 'Go to Line', and 'Show Completions', facilitating efficient text editing and navigation.
---

Paste
    
Insert contents of the system-wide clipboard into the current window.
The clipboard functions are also available in context menus. 

Find…
    
Open a search dialog with many options 

Find Again
    
Repeat the last search, if there is one. 

Find Selection
    
Search for the currently selected string, if there is one. 

Find in Files…
    
Open a file search dialog. Put results in a new output window. 

Replace…
    
Open a search-and-replace dialog. 

Go to Line
    
Move the cursor to the beginning of the line requested and make that line visible. A request past the end of the file goes to the end. Clear any selection and update the line and column status. 

Show Completions
    
Open a scrollable list allowing selection of existing names. See [Completions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#completions) in the Editing and navigation section below. 

Expand Word
    
Expand a prefix you have typed to match a full word in the same window; repeat to get a different expansion. 

Show Call Tip
    
After an unclosed parenthesis for a function, open a small window with function parameter hints. See [Calltips](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#calltips) in the Editing and navigation section below. 

Show Surrounding Parens
    
Highlight the surrounding parenthesis.
### Format menu (Editor window only)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#format-menu-editor-window-only "Link to this heading") 

Format Paragraph
    
Reformat the current blank-line-delimited paragraph in comment block or multiline string or selected line in a string. All lines in the paragraph will be formatted to less than N columns, where N defaults to 72. 

Indent Region
    
Shift selected lines right by the indent width (default 4 spaces). 

Dedent Region
    
Shift selected lines left by the indent width (default 4 spaces). 

Comment Out Region
    
Insert ## in front of selected lines. 

Uncomment Region
    
Remove leading # or ## from selected lines. 

Tabify Region
    
Turn _leading_ stretches of spaces into tabs. (Note: We recommend using 4 space blocks to indent Python code.) 

Untabify Region
    
Turn _all_ tabs into the correct number of spaces. 

Toggle Tabs
    
Open a dialog to switch between indenting with spaces and tabs. 

New Indent Width
    
Open a dialog to change indent width. The accepted default by the Python community is 4 spaces. 

Strip Trailing Chitespace
    
Remove trailing space and other whitespace characters after the last non-whitespace character of a line by applying str.rstrip to each line, including lines within multiline strings. Except for Shell windows, remove extra newlines at the end of the file.
### Run menu (Editor window only)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#run-menu-editor-window-only "Link to this heading") 

Run Module
    
Do [Check Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#check-module). If no error, restart the shell to clean the environment, then execute the module. Output is displayed in the Shell window. Note that output requires use of `print` or `write`. When execution is complete, the Shell retains focus and displays a prompt. At this point, one may interactively explore the result of execution. This is similar to executing a file with `python -i file` at a command line. 

Run… Customized
    
Same as [Run Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#run-module), but run the module with customized settings. _Command Line Arguments_ extend [`sys.argv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv "sys.argv") as if passed on a command line. The module can be run in the Shell without restarting. 

Check Module
    
Check the syntax of the module currently open in the Editor window. If the module has not been saved IDLE will either prompt the user to save or autosave, as selected in the General tab of the Idle Settings dialog. If there is a syntax error, the approximate location is indicated in the Editor window. 

Python Shell
    
Open or wake up the Python Shell window.
### Shell menu (Shell window only)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#shell-menu-shell-window-only "Link to this heading") 

View Last Restart
    
Scroll the shell window to the last Shell restart. 

Restart Shell
    
Restart the shell to clean the environment and reset display and exception handling. 

Previous History
    
Cycle through earlier commands in history which match the current entry. 

Next History
    
Cycle through later commands in history which match the current entry. 

Interrupt Execution
    
Stop a running program.
### Debug menu (Shell window only)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#debug-menu-shell-window-only "Link to this heading")

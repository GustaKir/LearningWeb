Title: Command Line Options for Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html
Summary: The document outlines command line options for Python, specifically the '-V' and '--version' options used to print the Python version number. It mentions additional details available with the '-VV' option, introduced in version 3.6, and notes warnings issued with the '-b' option when converting bytes or bytearrays to strings without specifying encoding.

-V[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-V "Link to this definition")


--version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-version "Link to this definition")
    
Print the Python version number and exit. Example output could be:
```
Python 3.8.0b2+

```

When given twice, print more information about the build, like:
```
Python 3.8.0b2+ (3.8:0c076caaa8, Apr 20 2019, 21:55:00)
[GCC 6.2.0 20161005]

```

Added in version 3.6: The `-VV` option.
### 1.1.3. Miscellaneous options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#miscellaneous-options "Link to this heading") 

-b[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-b "Link to this definition")
    
Issue a warning when converting [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") or [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray") to [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") without specifying encoding or comparing `bytes` or `bytearray` with `str` or `bytes` with [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"). Issue an error when the option is given twice (`-bb`).
Changed in version 3.5: Affects also comparisons of [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") with [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"). 

-B[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-B "Link to this definition")
    
If given, Python won’t try to write `.pyc` files on the import of source modules. See also [`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE). 

--check-hash-based-pycs default|always|never[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-check-hash-based-pycs "Link to this definition")
    
Control the validation behavior of hash-based `.pyc` files. See [Cached bytecode invalidation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#pyc-invalidation). When set to `default`, checked and unchecked hash-based bytecode cache files are validated according to their default semantics. When set to `always`, all hash-based `.pyc` files, whether checked or unchecked, are validated against their corresponding source file. When set to `never`, hash-based `.pyc` files are not validated against their corresponding source files.
The semantics of timestamp-based `.pyc` files are unaffected by this option. 

-d[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-d "Link to this definition")
    
Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only). See also the [`PYTHONDEBUG`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDEBUG) environment variable.
This option requires a [debug build of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build), otherwise it’s ignored. 

-E[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-E "Link to this definition")
    
Ignore all `PYTHON*` environment variables, e.g. [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) and [`PYTHONHOME`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHOME), that might be set.
See also the [`-P`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-P) and [`-I`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-I) (isolated) options. 

-i[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-i "Link to this definition")
    
Enter interactive mode after execution.
Using the [`-i`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-i) option will enter interactive mode in any of the following circumstances:
  * When a script is passed as first argument
  * When the [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option is used
  * When the [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) option is used


Interactive mode will start even when [`sys.stdin`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdin "sys.stdin") does not appear to be a terminal. The [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) file is not read.
This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception. See also [`PYTHONINSPECT`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONINSPECT).

Title: shlex Module Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html
Summary: This section describes key properties of the shlex module, including whitespace characters, escape characters used in POSIX mode, string quotes, and escaped quotes. By default, whitespace includes space, tab, linefeed, and carriage-return; escape characters are limited to the backslash; and quotes include ASCII single and double quotes.
---

shlex.whitespace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.whitespace "Link to this definition")
    
Characters that will be considered whitespace and skipped. Whitespace bounds tokens. By default, includes space, tab, linefeed and carriage-return. 

shlex.escape[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.escape "Link to this definition")
    
Characters that will be considered as escape. This will be only used in POSIX mode, and includes just `'\'` by default. 

shlex.quotes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.quotes "Link to this definition")
    
Characters that will be considered string quotes. The token accumulates until the same quote is encountered again (thus, different quote types protect each other as in the shell.) By default, includes ASCII single and double quotes. 

shlex.escapedquotes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.escapedquotes "Link to this definition")
    
Characters in [`quotes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.quotes "shlex.shlex.quotes") that will interpret escape characters defined in [`escape`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.escape "shlex.shlex.escape"). This is only used in POSIX mode, and includes just `'"'` by default. 

shlex.whitespace_split[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.whitespace_split "Link to this definition")
    
If `True`, tokens will only be split in whitespaces. This is useful, for example, for parsing command lines with [`shlex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex "shlex.shlex"), getting tokens in a similar way to shell arguments. When used in combination with [`punctuation_chars`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars "shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars"), tokens will be split on whitespace in addition to those characters.
Changed in version 3.8: The [`punctuation_chars`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars "shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars") attribute was made compatible with the [`whitespace_split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.whitespace_split "shlex.shlex.whitespace_split") attribute. 

shlex.infile[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.infile "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the current input file, as initially set at class instantiation time or stacked by later source requests. It may be useful to examine this when constructing error messages. 

shlex.instream[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.instream "Link to this definition")
    
The input stream from which this [`shlex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex "shlex.shlex") instance is reading characters. 

shlex.source[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.source "Link to this definition")
    
This attribute is `None` by default. If you assign a string to it, that string will be recognized as a lexical-level inclusion request similar to the `source` keyword in various shells. That is, the immediately following token will be opened as a filename and input will be taken from that stream until EOF, at which point the [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.close "io.IOBase.close") method of that stream will be called and the input source will again become the original input stream. Source requests may be stacked any number of levels deep. 

shlex.debug[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.debug "Link to this definition")
    
If this attribute is numeric and `1` or more, a [`shlex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex "shlex.shlex") instance will print verbose progress output on its behavior. If you need to use this, you can read the module source code to learn the details. 

shlex.lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
Source line number (count of newlines seen so far plus one). 

shlex.token[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.token "Link to this definition")
    
The token buffer. It may be useful to examine this when catching exceptions. 

shlex.eof[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.eof "Link to this definition")
    
Token used to determine end of file. This will be set to the empty string (`''`), in non-POSIX mode, and to `None` in POSIX mode.

Title: Deprecations in Python 3.5
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html
Summary: This section highlights several functions and flags that are deprecated in Python 3.5, including `inspect.signature()` as the preferred API, and the deprecation of `re.LOCALE` and `re.ASCII` with string patterns. Additionally, it notes that `getargvalues()` and `formatargvalues()` were mistakenly marked as deprecated in this release.

ecated in favor of the [`inspect.signature()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature "inspect.signature") API. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov in [bpo-20438](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20438).)
[`getargvalues()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.getargvalues "inspect.getargvalues") and [`formatargvalues()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.formatargvalues "inspect.formatargvalues") functions were inadvertently marked as deprecated with the release of Python 3.5.0.
Use of [`re.LOCALE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.LOCALE "re.LOCALE") flag with str patterns or [`re.ASCII`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.ASCII "re.ASCII") is now deprecated. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-22407](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22407).)
Use of unrecognized special sequences consisting of `'\'` and an ASCII letter in regular expression patterns and replacement patterns now raises a deprecation warning and will be forbidden in Python 3.6. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-23622](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23622).)
The undocumented and unofficial _use_load_tests_ default argument of the [`unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule "unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule") method now is deprecated and ignored. (Contributed by Robert Collins and Barry A. Warsaw in [bpo-16662](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16662).)
## Removed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#removed "Link to this heading")
### API and Feature Removals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#api-and-feature-removals "Link to this heading")
The following obsolete and previously deprecated APIs and features have been removed:
  * The `__version__` attribute has been dropped from the email package. The email code hasn’t been shipped separately from the stdlib for a long time, and the `__version__` string was not updated in the last few releases.
  * The internal `Netrc` class in the [`ftplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#module-ftplib "ftplib: FTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") module was deprecated in 3.4, and has now been removed. (Contributed by Matt Chaput in [bpo-6623](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6623).)
  * The concept of `.pyo` files has been removed.
  * The JoinableQueue class in the provisional [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") module was deprecated in 3.4.4 and is now removed. (Contributed by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis in [bpo-23464](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23464).)


## Porting to Python 3.5[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#porting-to-python-3-5 "Link to this heading")
This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that may require changes to your code.
### Changes in Python behavior[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#changes-in-python-behavior "Link to this heading")
  * Due to an oversight, earlier Python versions erroneously accepted the following syntax:
```
f(1 for x in [1], *args)
f(1 for x in [1], **kwargs)

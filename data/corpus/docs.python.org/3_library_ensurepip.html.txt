# `ensurepip` — Bootstrapping the `pip` installer[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.4.
**Source code:** [Lib/ensurepip](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/ensurepip)
The [`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "ensurepip: Bootstrapping the "pip" installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.") package provides support for bootstrapping the `pip` installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment. This bootstrapping approach reflects the fact that `pip` is an independent project with its own release cycle, and the latest available stable version is bundled with maintenance and feature releases of the CPython reference interpreter.
In most cases, end users of Python shouldn’t need to invoke this module directly (as `pip` should be bootstrapped by default), but it may be needed if installing `pip` was skipped when installing Python (or when creating a virtual environment) or after explicitly uninstalling `pip`.
Note
This module _does not_ access the internet. All of the components needed to bootstrap `pip` are included as internal parts of the package.

The original rationale and specification for this module.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): not Android, not iOS, not WASI.
This module is not supported on [mobile platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#mobile-availability) or [WebAssembly platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#wasm-availability).
## Command line interface[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#command-line-interface "Link to this heading")
The command line interface is invoked using the interpreter’s `-m` switch.
The simplest possible invocation is:
```
python -m ensurepip

```

This invocation will install `pip` if it is not already installed, but otherwise does nothing. To ensure the installed version of `pip` is at least as recent as the one available in `ensurepip`, pass the `--upgrade` option:
```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

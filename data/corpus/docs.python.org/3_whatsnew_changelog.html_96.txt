Title: Python Change Log Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This chunk highlights various updates and fixes in Python, including improvements to the compiler's line number propagation, a new thread-safe garbage collector for free-threaded builds, fixes for segmentation faults in `TypeError`, changes to the `END_FOR` instruction for loop supports, and enhancements to `queue.SimpleQueue`.

INT.
  * [gh-114265](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114265): Compiler propagates line numbers before optimization, leading to more optimization opportunities and removing the need for the `guarantee_lineno_for_exits` hack.
  * [gh-112529](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112529): The free-threaded build now has its own thread-safe GC implementation that uses mimalloc to find GC tracked objects. It is non-generational, unlike the existing GC implementation.
  * [gh-114050](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114050): Fix segmentation fault caused by an incorrect format string in `TypeError` exception when more than two arguments are passed to `int`.
  * [gh-112354](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112354): The `END_FOR` instruction now pops only one value. This is to better support side exits in loops.
  * [gh-113884](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113884): Make [`queue.SimpleQueue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.SimpleQueue "queue.SimpleQueue") thread safe when the GIL is disabled.
  * [gh-114058](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114058): Implement the foundations of the Tier 2 redundancy eliminator.
  * [gh-113939](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113939): frame.clear(): Clear frame.f_locals as well, and not only the fast locals. This is relevant once frame.f_locals was accessed, which would contain also references to all the locals.
  * [gh-112050](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112050): Convert [`collections.deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque") to use Argument Clinic.
  * [gh-112050](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112050): Make methods on [`collections.deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque") thread-safe when the GIL is disabled.
  * [gh-113464](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113464): Add an option (`--enable-experimental-jit` for `configure`-based builds or `--experimental-jit` for `PCbuild`-based ones) to build an _experimental_ just-in-time compiler, based on [copy-and-patch](https://fredrikbk.com/publications/copy-and-patch.pdf)
  * [gh-113055](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113055): Make interp->obmalloc a pointer. For interpreters that share state with the main interpreter, this points to the same static memory structure. For interpreters with their own obmalloc state, it is heap allocated. Add free_obmalloc_arenas() which will free the obmalloc arenas and radix tree structures for interpreters with their own obmalloc state.
  * [gh-55664](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/55664): Add warning when creating [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "type") using a namespace dictionary with non-string keys. Patched by Daniel Urban and Furkan Onder.
  * [gh-104530](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104530): Use native Win32 condition variables.

# `importlib.resources` – Package resource reading, opening and access[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#module-importlib.resources "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/importlib/resources/__init__.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/importlib/resources/__init__.py)
Added in version 3.7.
This module leverages Python’s import system to provide access to _resources_ within _packages_.
“Resources” are file-like resources associated with a module or package in Python. The resources may be contained directly in a package, within a subdirectory contained in that package, or adjacent to modules outside a package. Resources may be text or binary. As a result, Python module sources (.py) of a package and compilation artifacts (pycache) are technically de-facto resources of that package. In practice, however, resources are primarily those non-Python artifacts exposed specifically by the package author.
Resources can be opened or read in either binary or text mode.
Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it’s important to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor. Resources and packages **do not** have to exist as physical files and directories on the file system: for example, a package and its resources can be imported from a zip file using [`zipimport`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives.").
Note
This module provides functionality similar to [pkg_resources](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html) [Basic Resource Access](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#basic-resource-access) without the performance overhead of that package. This makes reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and consistent semantics.
The standalone backport of this module provides more information on [using importlib.resources](https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html) and [migrating from pkg_resources to importlib.resources](https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html).
[`Loaders`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader "importlib.abc.Loader") that wish to support resource reading should implement a `get_resource_reader(fullname)` method as specified by [`importlib.resources.abc.ResourceReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.ResourceReader "importlib.resources.abc.ResourceReader").

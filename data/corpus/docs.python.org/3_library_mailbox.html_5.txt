Title: Maildir Class in Python's Mailbox Library
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html
Summary: The `mailbox.Maildir` class is a subclass of `Mailbox` designed for handling mailboxes in Maildir format. It supports a customizable message representation through a callable factory and includes options to create the mailbox if it doesn't exist. The parameter naming for the mailbox directory is historically rooted.

_class_ mailbox.Maildir(_dirname_ , _factory =None_, _create =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`Mailbox`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Mailbox "mailbox.Mailbox") for mailboxes in Maildir format. Parameter _factory_ is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation (which behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation. If _factory_ is `None`, [`MaildirMessage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MaildirMessage "mailbox.MaildirMessage") is used as the default message representation. If _create_ is `True`, the mailbox is created if it does not exist.
If _create_ is `True` and the _dirname_ path exists, it will be treated as an existing maildir without attempting to verify its directory layout.
It is for historical reasons that _dirname_ is named as such rather than _path_.
Maildir is a directory-based mailbox format invented for the qmail mail transfer agent and now widely supported by other programs. Messages in a Maildir mailbox are stored in separate files within a common directory structure. This design allows Maildir mailboxes to be accessed and modified by multiple unrelated programs without data corruption, so file locking is unnecessary.
Maildir mailboxes contain three subdirectories, namely: `tmp`, `new`, and `cur`. Messages are created momentarily in the `tmp` subdirectory and then moved to the `new` subdirectory to finalize delivery. A mail user agent may subsequently move the message to the `cur` subdirectory and store information about the state of the message in a special “info” section appended to its file name.
Folders of the style introduced by the Courier mail transfer agent are also supported. Any subdirectory of the main mailbox is considered a folder if `'.'` is the first character in its name. Folder names are represented by `Maildir` without the leading `'.'`. Each folder is itself a Maildir mailbox but should not contain other folders. Instead, a logical nesting is indicated using `'.'` to delimit levels, e.g., “Archived.2005.07”. 

colon[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.colon "Link to this definition")
    
The Maildir specification requires the use of a colon (`':'`) in certain message file names. However, some operating systems do not permit this character in file names, If you wish to use a Maildir-like format on such an operating system, you should specify another character to use instead. The exclamation point (`'!'`) is a popular choice. For example:
```
importmailbox
mailbox.Maildir.colon = '!'

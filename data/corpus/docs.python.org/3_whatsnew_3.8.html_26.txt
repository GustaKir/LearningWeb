Title: API and Feature Removals in Python 3.8
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html
Summary: Python 3.8 removes several deprecated features and APIs, including the import of ABCs from 'collections', which was previously marked for removal, and the 'macpath' module. The 'platform.popen()' function has also been removed due to prior deprecation.

## API and Feature Removals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#api-and-feature-removals "Link to this heading")
The following features and APIs have been removed from Python 3.8:
  * Starting with Python 3.3, importing ABCs from [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") was deprecated, and importing should be done from [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers"). Being able to import from collections was marked for removal in 3.8, but has been delayed to 3.9. (See [gh-81134](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81134).)
  * The `macpath` module, deprecated in Python 3.7, has been removed. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-35471](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35471).)
  * The function `platform.popen()` has been removed, after having been deprecated since Python 3.3: use [`os.popen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen "os.popen") instead. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-35345](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35345).)
  * The function `time.clock()` has been removed, after having been deprecated since Python 3.3: use [`time.perf_counter()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter "time.perf_counter") or [`time.process_time()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time "time.process_time") instead, depending on your requirements, to have well-defined behavior. (Contributed by Matthias Bussonnier in [bpo-36895](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36895).)
  * The `pyvenv` script has been removed in favor of `python3.8 -m venv` to help eliminate confusion as to what Python interpreter the `pyvenv` script is tied to. (Contributed by Brett Cannon in [bpo-25427](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25427).)
  * `parse_qs`, `parse_qsl`, and `escape` are removed from the `cgi` module. They are deprecated in Python 3.2 or older. They should be imported from the `urllib.parse` and `html` modules instead.
  * `filemode` function is removed from the [`tarfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files.") module. It is not documented and deprecated since Python 3.3.
  * The [`XMLParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser "xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser") constructor no longer accepts the _html_ argument. It never had an effect and was deprecated in Python 3.4. All other parameters are now [keyword-only](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#keyword-only-parameter). (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-29209](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29209).)
  * Removed the `doctype()` method of [`XMLParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser "xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser"). (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-29209](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29209).)
  * “unicode_internal” codec is removed. (Contributed by Inada Naoki in [bpo-36297](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36297).)
  * The `Cache` and `Statement` objects of the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") module are not exposed to the user. (Contributed by Aviv Palivoda in [bpo-30262](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30262).)
  * The `bufsize` keyword argument of [`fileinput.input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html#fileinput.input "fileinput.input") and [`fileinput.FileInput()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html#fileinput.FileInput "fileinput.FileInput") which was ignored and deprecated since Python 3.6 has been removed. [bpo-36952](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36952) (Contributed by Matthias Bussonnier.)
  * The functions `sys.set_coroutine_wrapper()` and `sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()` deprecated in Python 3.7 have been removed; [bpo-36933](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36933) (Contributed by Matthias Bussonnier.)

Title: Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85 Data Encodings
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html
Summary: This section provides an overview of the `base64` module in Python, which includes various encoding schemes such as Base16, Base32, Base64, and Base85. It is important to understand the security considerations related to these encodings.

# `base64` — Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85 Data Encodings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#module-base64 "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/base64.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/base64.py)
This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. It provides encoding and decoding functions for the encodings specified in [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html), which defines the Base16, Base32, and Base64 algorithms, and for the de-facto standard Ascii85 and Base85 encodings.
The [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) encodings are suitable for encoding binary data so that it can be safely sent by email, used as parts of URLs, or included as part of an HTTP POST request. The encoding algorithm is not the same as the **uuencode** program.
There are two interfaces provided by this module. The modern interface supports encoding [bytes-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) to ASCII [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), and decoding [bytes-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or strings containing ASCII to [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"). Both base-64 alphabets defined in [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) (normal, and URL- and filesystem-safe) are supported.
The legacy interface does not support decoding from strings, but it does provide functions for encoding and decoding to and from [file objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object). It only supports the Base64 standard alphabet, and it adds newlines every 76 characters as per [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html). Note that if you are looking for [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html) support you probably want to be looking at the [`email`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages.") package instead.
Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only Unicode strings are now accepted by the decoding functions of the modern interface.
Changed in version 3.4: Any [bytes-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) are now accepted by all encoding and decoding functions in this module. Ascii85/Base85 support added.
The modern interface provides:

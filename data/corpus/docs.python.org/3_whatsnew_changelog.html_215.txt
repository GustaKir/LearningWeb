Title: Python Library Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section highlights recent changes in the Python library, including a bug fix in `urllib.parse.urlparse()` for incorrect URL scheme parsing, the deprecation of `asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher`, performance improvements to `secrets.token_hex()`, and bug fixes in `inspect.signature()`. These updates contribute to enhanced functionality and performance in Python.

### Library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id198 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-99418](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418): Fix bug in [`urllib.parse.urlparse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse "urllib.parse.urlparse") that causes URL schemes that begin with a digit, a plus sign, or a minus sign to be parsed incorrectly.
  * [gh-94597](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94597): Deprecate [`asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher "asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher") to be removed in Python 3.14. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-99305](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99305): Improve performance of [`secrets.token_hex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_hex "secrets.token_hex").
  * [gh-74044](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74044): Fixed bug where [`inspect.signature()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature "inspect.signature") reported incorrect arguments for decorated methods.
  * [gh-99275](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99275): Fix `SystemError` in [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.") when exception was not set during `__initsubclass__`.
  * [gh-99277](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99277): Remove older version of `_SSLProtocolTransport.get_write_buffer_limits` in `asyncio.sslproto`
  * [gh-99248](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99248): fix negative numbers failing in verify()
  * [gh-99155](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99155): Fix [`statistics.NormalDist`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist "statistics.NormalDist") pickle with `0` and `1` protocols.
  * [gh-93464](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93464): `enum.auto()` is now correctly activated when combined with other assignment values. E.g. `ONE = auto(), 'some text'` will now evaluate as `(1, 'some text')`.
  * [gh-99134](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99134): Update the bundled copy of pip to version 22.3.1.
  * [gh-92584](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92584): Remove the `distutils` package. It was deprecated in Python 3.10 by [**PEP 632**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/) “Deprecate distutils module”. For projects still using `distutils` and cannot be updated to something else, the `setuptools` project can be installed: it still provides `distutils`. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-98999](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98999): Now `_pyio` is consistent with `_io` in raising `ValueError` when executing methods over closed buffers.
  * [gh-83004](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83004): Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in `_zoneinfo`
  * [gh-83004](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83004): Clean up refleaks on failed module initialisation in `_pickle`
  * [gh-83004](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83004): Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in `_io`.
  * [gh-98897](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98897): Fix memory leak in [`math.dist()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.dist "math.dist") when both points don’t have the same dimension. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-98878](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98878): Use the frame bound builtins when offering a name suggestion in [`traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#module-traceback "traceback: Print or retrieve a stack traceback.") to prevent crashing when `__builtins__` is not a dict.
  * [gh-98139](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98139): In `importlib._bootstrap`, enhance namespace package repr to `<module 'x' (namespace) from ['path']>`.
  * [gh-90352](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90352): Fix `_SelectorDatagramTransport` to inherit from [`DatagramTransport`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio.DatagramTransport "asyncio.DatagramTransport") in [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O."). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-98793](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98793): Fix argument typechecks in `_overlapped.WSAConnect()` and `_overlapped.Overlapped.WSASendTo()` functions.
  * [gh-98744](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98744): Prevent crashing in [`traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#module-traceback "traceback: Print or retrieve a stack traceback.") when retrieving the byte-offset for some source files that contain certain unicode characters.
  * [gh-98740](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98740): Fix internal error in the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") module which in very rare circumstances prevented compilation of a regular expression containing a

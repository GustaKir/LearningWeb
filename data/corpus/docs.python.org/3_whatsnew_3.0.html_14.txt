Title: Performance and Porting Strategies in Python 3.0
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
Summary: Python 3.0 runs the pystone benchmark about 10% slower than Python 2.5, primarily due to generalizations and the removal of special-casing for small integers. For porting from Python 2.5 or 2.6 to 3.0, it is advised to start with good test coverage, upgrade to Python 2.6, and enable the '-3' command line switch to identify code that may need changes.

## Performance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#performance "Link to this heading")
The net result of the 3.0 generalizations is that Python 3.0 runs the pystone benchmark around 10% slower than Python 2.5. Most likely the biggest cause is the removal of special-casing for small integers. There’s room for improvement, but it will happen after 3.0 is released!
## Porting To Python 3.0[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#porting-to-python-3-0 "Link to this heading")
For porting existing Python 2.5 or 2.6 source code to Python 3.0, the best strategy is the following:
  1. (Prerequisite:) Start with excellent test coverage.
  2. Port to Python 2.6. This should be no more work than the average port from Python 2.x to Python 2.(x+1). Make sure all your tests pass.
  3. (Still using 2.6:) Turn on the `-3` command line switch. This enables warnings about features that will be removed (or change) in 3.0. Run your test suite again, and fix code that you get warnings about until there are no warnings left, and all your tests still pass.
  4. Run the `2to3` source-to-source translator over your source code tree. Run the result of the translation under Python 3.0. Manually fix up any remaining issues, fixing problems until all tests pass again.


It is not recommended to try to write source code that runs unchanged under both Python 2.6 and 3.0; you’d have to use a very contorted coding style, e.g. avoiding `print` statements, metaclasses, and much more. If you are maintaining a library that needs to support both Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, the best approach is to modify step 3 above by editing the 2.6 version of the source code and running the `2to3` translator again, rather than editing the 3.0 version of the source code.

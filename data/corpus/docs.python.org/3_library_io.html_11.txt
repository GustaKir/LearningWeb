Title: BytesIO Class in Python I/O Library
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html
Summary: This section discusses the `BytesIO` class, including its immutability while the view exists, the `getvalue()` method to retrieve the buffer's contents as bytes, and the `read1()` and `readinto1()` methods. It notes changes in behavior introduced in versions 3.2 and 3.7.

```

Note
As long as the view exists, the [`BytesIO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO") object cannot be resized or closed.
Added in version 3.2. 

getvalue()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO.getvalue "Link to this definition")
    
Return [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") containing the entire contents of the buffer. 

read1(_size =-1_, _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO.read1 "Link to this definition")
    
In [`BytesIO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO"), this is the same as [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.read "io.BufferedIOBase.read").
Changed in version 3.7: The _size_ argument is now optional. 

readinto1(_b_ , _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO.readinto1 "Link to this definition")
    
In [`BytesIO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO"), this is the same as [`readinto()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.readinto "io.BufferedIOBase.readinto").
Added in version 3.5. 

_class_ io.BufferedReader(_raw_ , _buffer_size =DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader "Link to this definition")
    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a readable, non seekable [`RawIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase "io.RawIOBase") raw binary stream. It inherits from [`BufferedIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase").
When reading data from this object, a larger amount of data may be requested from the underlying raw stream, and kept in an internal buffer. The buffered data can then be returned directly on subsequent reads.
The constructor creates a [`BufferedReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader "io.BufferedReader") for the given readable _raw_ stream and _buffer_size_. If _buffer_size_ is omitted, [`DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE "io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE") is used.
[`BufferedReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader "io.BufferedReader") provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from [`BufferedIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase") and [`IOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase "io.IOBase"): 

peek(_size =0_, _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader.peek "Link to this definition")
    
Return bytes from the stream without advancing the position. At most one single read on the raw stream is done to satisfy the call. The number of bytes returned may be less or more than requested. 

read(_size =-1_, _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader.read "Link to this definition")
    
Read and return _size_ bytes, or if _size_ is not given or negative, until EOF or if the read call would block in non-blocking mode. 

read1(_size =-1_, _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader.read1 "Link to this definition")
    
Read and return up to _size_ bytes with only one call on the raw stream. If at least one byte is buffered, only buffered bytes are returned. Otherwise, one raw stream read call is made.
Changed in version 3.7: The _size_ argument is now optional. 

_class_ io.BufferedWriter(_raw_ , _buffer_size =DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedWriter "Link to this definition")
    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a writeable, non seekable [`RawIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase "io.RawIOBase") raw binary stream. It inherits from [`BufferedIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase").
When writing to this object, data is normally placed into an internal buffer. The buffer will be written out to the underlying [`RawIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase "io.RawIOBase") object under various conditions, including:
  * when the buffer gets too small for all pending data;
  * when [`flush()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedWriter.flush "io.BufferedWriter.flush") is called;
  * when a [`seek()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.seek "io.IOBase.seek") is requested (for [`BufferedRandom`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedRandom "io.BufferedRandom") objects);
  * when the [`BufferedWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedWriter "io.BufferedWriter") object is closed or destroyed.

---

edirect&bpo=41323): Constant tuple folding in bytecode optimizer now reuses tuple in constant table.
  * [bpo-43846](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43846): Data stack usage is much reduced for large literal and call expressions.
  * [bpo-38530](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38530): When printing [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError") raised by the interpreter, `PyErr_Display()` will offer suggestions of similar variable names in the function that the exception was raised from. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  * [bpo-43823](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43823): Improve syntax errors for invalid dictionary literals. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [bpo-43822](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43822): Improve syntax errors in the parser for missing commas between expressions. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [bpo-43798](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43798): [`ast.alias`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.alias "ast.alias") nodes now include source location metadata attributes e.g. lineno, col_offset.
  * [bpo-43797](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43797): Improve `SyntaxError` error messages for invalid comparisons. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [bpo-43760](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43760): Move the flag for checking whether tracing is enabled to the C stack, from the heap. Should speed up dispatch in the interpreter.
  * [bpo-43682](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43682): Static methods ([`@staticmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod")) and class methods ([`@classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod "classmethod")) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new `__wrapped__` attribute. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-43751](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43751): Fixed a bug where `anext(ait, default)` would erroneously return None.
  * [bpo-42128](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42128): [`__match_args__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__match_args__ "object.__match_args__") is no longer allowed to be a list.
  * [bpo-43683](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43683): Add GEN_START opcode. Marks start of generator, including async, or coroutine and handles sending values to a newly created generator or coroutine.
  * [bpo-43105](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43105): Importlib now resolves relative paths when creating module spec objects from file locations.
  * [bpo-43682](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43682): Static methods ([`@staticmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod")) are now callable as regular functions. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-42609](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42609): Prevented crashes in the AST validator and optimizer when compiling some absurdly long expressions like `"+0"*1000000`. [`RecursionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RecursionError "RecursionError") is now raised instead.
  * [bpo-38530](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38530): When printing [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"), `PyErr_Display()` will offer suggestions of similar attribute names in the object that the exception was raised from.

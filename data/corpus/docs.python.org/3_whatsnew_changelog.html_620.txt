### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id567 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-31493](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31493): IDLE code context – fix code update and font update timers. Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test_idle completes.
  * [bpo-31488](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31488): IDLE - Update non-key options in former extension classes. When applying configdialog changes, call .reload for each feature class. Change ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached to existing editor windows.
  * [bpo-31477](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31477): IDLE - Improve rstrip entry in doc. Strip trailing whitespace strips more than blank spaces. Multiline string literals are not skipped.
  * [bpo-31480](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31480): IDLE - make tests pass with zzdummy extension disabled by default.
  * [bpo-31421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31421): Document how IDLE runs tkinter programs. IDLE calls tcl/tk update in the background in order to make live interaction and experimentation with tkinter applications much easier.
  * [bpo-31414](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31414): IDLE – fix tk entry box tests by deleting first. Adding to an int entry is not the same as deleting and inserting because int(‘’) will fail.
  * [bpo-31051](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31051): Rearrange IDLE configdialog GenPage into Window, Editor, and Help sections.
  * [bpo-30617](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30617): IDLE - Add docstrings and tests for outwin subclass of editor. Move some data and functions from the class to module level. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31287](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31287): IDLE - Do not modify tkinter.message in test_configdialog.
  * [bpo-27099](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27099): Convert IDLE’s built-in ‘extensions’ to regular features. About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions. Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not good for maintenance. Hence the conversion. The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for builtin features are now handled uniformly. Now, editing a binding in a keyset only affects its value in the keyset. All bindings are defined together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def. All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg. All take effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok. The affected events are ‘<<force-open-completions>>’, ‘<<expand-word>>’, ‘<<force-open-calltip>>’, ‘<<flash-paren>>’, ‘<<format-paragraph>>’, ‘<<run-module>>’, ‘<<check-module>>’, and ‘<<zoom-height>>’. Any (global) customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa. Initial patch by Charles Wohlganger.
  * [bpo-31206](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31206): IDLE: Factor HighPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31001](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31001): Add tests for configdialog highlight tab. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31205](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31205): IDLE: Factor KeysPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog. The slightly modified tests continue to pass. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31130](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31130): IDLE – stop leaks in test_configdialog. Initial patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-31002](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31002): Add tests for configdialog keys tab. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-19903](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19903): IDLE: Calltips use `inspect.signature` instead of `inspect.getfullargspec`. This improves calltips for builtins converted to use Argument Clinic. Patch by Louie Lu.
  * [bpo-31083](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31083): IDLE - Add an outline of a TabPage class in configdialog. Update existing classes to match outline. Initial patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31050](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31050): Factor GenPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog. The slightly modified tests continue to pass. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31004](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31004): IDLE - Factor FontPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog. Slightly modified tests continue to pass. Fix General tests. Patch mostly by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-30781](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30781): IDLE - Use ttk widgets

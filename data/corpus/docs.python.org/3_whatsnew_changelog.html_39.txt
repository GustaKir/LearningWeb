Title: Python 3.10 Changelog Highlights
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document outlines key updates in Python 3.10, including enhancements to the `argparse` library for handling positional arguments and improving error messages, as well as the addition of a reserved IPv6 block in the `ipaddress` module.
---

This allows to use positional argument with `nargs='*'` and without `default` in mutually exclusive group and improves error message about required arguments.
  * [gh-59317](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/59317): Fix parsing positional argument with [nargs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs) equal to `'?'` or `'*'` if it is preceded by an option and another positional argument.
  * [gh-53780](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/53780): [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library.") now ignores the first `"--"` (double dash) between an option and command.
  * [gh-124217](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124217): Add RFC 9637 reserved IPv6 block `3fff::/20` in [`ipaddress`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#module-ipaddress "ipaddress: IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library.") module.
  * [gh-81691](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81691): Fix handling of multiple `"--"` (double dashes) in [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library."). Only the first one has now been removed, all subsequent ones are now taken literally.
  * [gh-123978](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123978): Remove broken [`time.thread_time()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.thread_time "time.thread_time") and [`time.thread_time_ns()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.thread_time_ns "time.thread_time_ns") on NetBSD.
  * [gh-124008](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124008): Fix possible crash (in debug build), incorrect output or returning incorrect value from raw binary `write()` when writing to console on Windows.
  * [gh-123935](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123935): Fix parent slots detection for dataclasses that inherit from classes with `__dictoffset__`.
  * [gh-122765](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122765): Fix unbalanced quote errors occurring when activate.csh in [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments.") was sourced with a custom prompt containing unpaired quotes or newlines.
  * [gh-123370](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123370): Fix the canvas not clearing after running turtledemo clock.
  * [gh-116810](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116810): Resolve a memory leak introduced in CPython 3.10â€™s [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") when the [`ssl.SSLSocket.session`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLSocket.session "ssl.SSLSocket.session") property was accessed. Speeds up read and write access to said property by no longer unnecessarily cloning session objects via serialization.
  * [gh-120754](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120754): Update unbounded `read` calls in [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") to specify an explicit `size` putting a limit on how much data they may read.

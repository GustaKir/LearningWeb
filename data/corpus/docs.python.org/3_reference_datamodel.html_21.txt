Title: Traceback Attributes and Slice Objects in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
Summary: This section describes the `traceback.tb_lasti` attribute, indicating the precise instruction in a traceback, which may differ from the frame object's line number under certain conditions. It also explains the `traceback.tb_next` attribute, which points to the next level in the stack trace and is writable since Python 3.7. Additionally, it introduces the concept of slice objects.

traceback.tb_lasti[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_lasti "Link to this definition")
| Indicates the “precise instruction”.  
The line number and last instruction in the traceback may differ from the line number of its [frame object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) if the exception occurred in a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with no matching except clause or with a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause. 

traceback.tb_next[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback.tb_next "Link to this definition")
    
The special writable attribute `tb_next` is the next level in the stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or `None` if there is no next level.
Changed in version 3.7: This attribute is now writable
#### 3.2.13.4. Slice objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slice-objects "Link to this heading")
Slice objects are used to represent slices for [`__getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__ "object.__getitem__") methods. They are also created by the built-in [`slice()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice "slice") function.
Special read-only attributes: [`start`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.start "slice.start") is the lower bound; [`stop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.stop "slice.stop") is the upper bound; [`step`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice.step "slice.step") is the step value; each is `None` if omitted. These attributes can have any type.
Slice objects support one method:

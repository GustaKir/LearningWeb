### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id701 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-26799](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26799): Fix python-gdb.py: don’t get C types once when the Python code is loaded, but get C types on demand. The C types can change if python-gdb.py is loaded before the Python executable. Patch written by Thomas Ilsche.
  * [bpo-26271](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26271): Fix the Freeze tool to properly use flags passed through configure. Patch by Daniel Shaulov.
  * [bpo-26489](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26489): Add dictionary unpacking support to Tools/parser/unparse.py. Patch by Guo Ci Teo.
  * [bpo-26316](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26316): Fix variable name typo in Argument Clinic.
  * [bpo-25440](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25440): Fix output of python-config –extension-suffix.
  * [bpo-25154](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25154): The pyvenv script has been deprecated in favour of `python3 -m venv`.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id702 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-26312](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26312): SystemError is now raised in all programming bugs with using PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords(). RuntimeError did raised before in some programming bugs.
  * [bpo-26198](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26198): ValueError is now raised instead of TypeError on buffer overflow in parsing “es#” and “et#” format units. SystemError is now raised instead of TypeError on programmatical error in parsing format string.


## Python 3.5.5 final[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-5-final "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2018-02-04_
There were no new changes in version 3.5.5.
## Python 3.5.5 release candidate 1[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-5-release-candidate-1 "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2018-01-23_
### Security[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id703 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-32551](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32551): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29139) caused a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import location. This is considered a potential security issue, as it may lead to privileged processes unexpectedly loading code from user controlled directories in situations where that was not previously the case. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import location’s parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other `sys.path` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location named on the command line. (Originally reported as [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29723) against Python 3.6rc1, but it was missed at the time that the then upcoming Python 3.5.4 release would also be affected)
  * [bpo-30657](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30657): Fixed possible integer overflow in PyBytes_DecodeEscape, [**CVE 2017-1000158**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-1000158). Original patch by Jay Bosamiya; rebased to Python 3 by Miro Hrončok.
  * [bpo-30947](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30947): Upgrade libexpat embedded copy from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 to get security fixes.


### Core and Builtins[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id704 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-31095](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31095): Fix potential crash during GC caused by `tp_dealloc` which doesn’t call `PyObject_GC_UnTrack()`.


### Library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id705 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-32072](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32072): Fixed issues with binary plists: Fixed saving bytearrays. Identical objects will be saved only once. Equal references will be load as identical objects. Added support for saving and loading recursive data structures.
  * [bpo-31170](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31170): expat: Update libexpat from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4. Fix copying of partial characters for UTF-8 input (libexpat bug 115): <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/115>

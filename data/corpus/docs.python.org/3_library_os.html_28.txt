Title: os.listdir() Function
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: The os.listdir() function returns a list of entries in the specified directory (_path_), excluding special entries '.' and '..'. The order of the entries is arbitrary, and changes to the directory during the call may affect the result. The function supports path-like objects, and if _path_ is of type bytes, the filenames returned will also be bytes. Additionally, a file descriptor referring to a directory can be specified.

os.listdir(_path ='.'_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by _path_. The list is in arbitrary order, and does not include the special entries `'.'` and `'..'` even if they are present in the directory. If a file is removed from or added to the directory during the call of this function, whether a name for that file be included is unspecified.
_path_ may be a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object). If _path_ is of type `bytes` (directly or indirectly through the [`PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike "os.PathLike") interface), the filenames returned will also be of type `bytes`; in all other circumstances, they will be of type `str`.
This function can also support [specifying a file descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#path-fd); the file descriptor must refer to a directory.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `os.listdir` with argument `path`.
Note
To encode `str` filenames to `bytes`, use [`fsencode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode "os.fsencode").

The [`scandir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir "os.scandir") function returns directory entries along with file attribute information, giving better performance for many common use cases.
Changed in version 3.2: The _path_ parameter became optional.
Changed in version 3.3: Added support for specifying _path_ as an open file descriptor.
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object). 

os.listdrives()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdrives "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list containing the names of drives on a Windows system.
A drive name typically looks like `'C:\\'`. Not every drive name will be associated with a volume, and some may be inaccessible for a variety of reasons, including permissions, network connectivity or missing media. This function does not test for access.
May raise [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if an error occurs collecting the drive names.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `os.listdrives` with no arguments.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Windows
Added in version 3.12. 

os.listmounts(_volume_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listmounts "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list containing the mount points for a volume on a Windows system.
_volume_ must be represented as a GUID path, like those returned by [`os.listvolumes()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listvolumes "os.listvolumes"). Volumes may be mounted in multiple locations or not at all. In the latter case, the list will be empty. Mount points that are not associated with a volume will not be returned by this function.
The mount points return by this function will be absolute paths, and may be longer than the drive name.
Raises [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if the volume is not recognized or if an error occurs collecting the paths.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `os.listmounts` with argument `volume`.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Windows
Added in version 3.12. 

os.listvolumes()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listvolumes "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list containing the volumes in the system.
Volumes are typically represented as a GUID path that looks like `\\?\Volume{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}\`. Files can usually be accessed through a GUID path, permissions allowing. However, users are generally not familiar with them, and so the recommended use of this function is to retrieve mount points using [`os.listmounts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listmounts "os.listmounts").
May raise [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if an error occurs collecting the volumes.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `os.listvolumes` with no arguments.

Title: Python 3.13 Release Notes - Changes and Removals
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html
Summary: This section outlines various contributions and removals in Python 3.13, including the elimination of the `_PyInterpreterState_Get()` alias, the private `_PyObject_FastCall()` function, and the `cpython/pytime.h` header file, all aimed at improving compatibility and utilizing more current APIs since Python 3.8.

  * Remove the `_PyInterpreterState_Get()` alias to [`PyInterpreterState_Get()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterState_Get "PyInterpreterState_Get") which was kept for backward compatibility with Python 3.8. The [pythoncapi-compat project](https://github.com/python/pythoncapi-compat/) can be used to get [`PyInterpreterState_Get()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterState_Get "PyInterpreterState_Get") on Python 3.8 and older.

  * Remove the private `_PyObject_FastCall()` function: use `PyObject_Vectorcall()` which is available since Python 3.8 ([**PEP 590**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0590/)). (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-106023](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106023).)
  * Remove the `cpython/pytime.h` header file, which only contained private functions. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-106316](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106316).)
  * Remove the undocumented `PY_TIMEOUT_MAX` constant from the limited C API. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-110014](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110014).)
  * Remove the old trashcan macros `Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN` and `Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END`. Replace both with the new macros `Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN` and `Py_TRASHCAN_END`. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-105111](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105111).)

Title: Curses Library Window Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html
Summary: This section describes the `noutrefresh()` function, which marks a window for refresh without updating the screen immediately, and explains the `overlay()` function that allows a window to be overlayed on another without destroying the existing content. Both functions are essential for managing window states in the Curses library.

window.noutrefresh()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.noutrefresh "Link to this definition")
    
Mark for refresh but wait. This function updates the data structure representing the desired state of the window, but does not force an update of the physical screen. To accomplish that, call [`doupdate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.doupdate "curses.doupdate"). 

window.overlay(_destwin_[, _sminrow_ , _smincol_ , _dminrow_ , _dmincol_ , _dmaxrow_ , _dmaxcol_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.overlay "Link to this definition")
    
Overlay the window on top of _destwin_. The windows need not be the same size, only the overlapping region is copied. This copy is non-destructive, which means that the current background character does not overwrite the old contents of _destwin_.
To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of [`overlay()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.overlay "curses.window.overlay") can be used. _sminrow_ and _smincol_ are the upper-left coordinates of the source window, and the other variables mark a rectangle in the destination window. 

window.overwrite(_destwin_[, _sminrow_ , _smincol_ , _dminrow_ , _dmincol_ , _dmaxrow_ , _dmaxcol_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.overwrite "Link to this definition")
    
Overwrite the window on top of _destwin_. The windows need not be the same size, in which case only the overlapping region is copied. This copy is destructive, which means that the current background character overwrites the old contents of _destwin_.
To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of [`overwrite()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.overwrite "curses.window.overwrite") can be used. _sminrow_ and _smincol_ are the upper-left coordinates of the source window, the other variables mark a rectangle in the destination window. 

window.putwin(_file_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.putwin "Link to this definition")
    
Write all data associated with the window into the provided file object. This information can be later retrieved using the [`getwin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.getwin "curses.getwin") function. 

window.redrawln(_beg_ , _num_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.redrawln "Link to this definition")
    
Indicate that the _num_ screen lines, starting at line _beg_ , are corrupted and should be completely redrawn on the next [`refresh()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "curses.window.refresh") call. 

window.redrawwin()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.redrawwin "Link to this definition")
    
Touch the entire window, causing it to be completely redrawn on the next [`refresh()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "curses.window.refresh") call. 

window.refresh([_pminrow_ , _pmincol_ , _sminrow_ , _smincol_ , _smaxrow_ , _smaxcol_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "Link to this definition")
    
Update the display immediately (sync actual screen with previous drawing/deleting methods).
The 6 optional arguments can only be specified when the window is a pad created with [`newpad()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.newpad "curses.newpad"). The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the pad and screen are involved. _pminrow_ and _pmincol_ specify the upper left-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad. _sminrow_ , _smincol_ , _smaxrow_ , and _smaxcol_ specify the edges of the rectangle to be displayed on the screen. The lower right-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates, since the rectangles must be the same size. Both rectangles must be entirely contained within their respective structures. Negative values of _pminrow_ , _pmincol_ , _sminrow_ , or _smincol_ are treated as if they were zero. 

window.resize(_nlines_ , _ncols_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.resize "Link to this definition")
    
Reallocate storage for a curses window to adjust its dimensions to the specified values. If either dimension is larger than the current values, the window’s data is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition (as set by [`bkgdset()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.bkgdset "curses.window.bkgdset")) merged into them. 

window.scroll([_lines=1_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.scroll "Link to this definition")
    
Scroll the screen or scrolling region upward by _lines_ lines.

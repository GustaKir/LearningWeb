Title: DocTest Objects
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
Summary: The `doctest.DocTest` class represents a collection of doctest examples designed to be executed in a shared namespace, initialized with specific attributes like examples, globals, name, filename, line number, and docstring.

### DocTest Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ doctest.DocTest(_examples_ , _globs_ , _name_ , _filename_ , _lineno_ , _docstring_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "Link to this definition")
    
A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single namespace. The constructor arguments are used to initialize the attributes of the same names.
[`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") defines the following attributes. They are initialized by the constructor, and should not be modified directly. 

examples[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.examples "Link to this definition")
    
A list of [`Example`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") objects encoding the individual interactive Python examples that should be run by this test. 

globs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.globs "Link to this definition")
    
The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should be run in. This is a dictionary mapping names to values. Any changes to the namespace made by the examples (such as binding new variables) will be reflected in [`globs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.globs "doctest.DocTest.globs") after the test is run. 

name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.name "Link to this definition")
    
A string name identifying the [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest"). Typically, this is the name of the object or file that the test was extracted from. 

filename[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.filename "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the file that this [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") was extracted from; or `None` if the filename is unknown, or if the [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") was not extracted from a file. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number within [`filename`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.filename "doctest.DocTest.filename") where this [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable. This line number is zero-based with respect to the beginning of the file. 

docstring[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest.docstring "Link to this definition")
    
The string that the test was extracted from, or `None` if the string is unavailable, or if the test was not extracted from a string.
### Example Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#example-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ doctest.Example(_source_ , _want_ , _exc_msg =None_, _lineno =0_, _indent =0_, _options =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "Link to this definition")
    
A single interactive example, consisting of a Python statement and its expected output. The constructor arguments are used to initialize the attributes of the same names.
[`Example`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") defines the following attributes. They are initialized by the constructor, and should not be modified directly. 

source[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example.source "Link to this definition")
    
A string containing the example’s source code. This source code consists of a single Python statement, and always ends with a newline; the constructor adds a newline when necessary. 

want[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example.want "Link to this definition")
    
The expected output from running the example’s source code (either from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception). [`want`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example.want "doctest.Example.want") ends with a newline unless no output is expected, in which case it’s an empty string. The constructor adds a newline when necessary.

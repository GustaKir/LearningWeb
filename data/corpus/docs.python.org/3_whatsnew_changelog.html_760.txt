Initial patch by Vajrasky Kok.
  * [bpo-21226](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21226): Set up modules properly in PyImport_ExecCodeModuleObject (and friends).
  * [bpo-21398](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21398): Fix a unicode error in the pydoc pager when the documentation contains characters not encodable to the stdout encoding.
  * [bpo-16531](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16531): ipaddress.IPv4Network and ipaddress.IPv6Network now accept an (address, netmask) tuple argument, so as to easily construct network objects from existing addresses.
  * [bpo-21156](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21156): importlib.abc.InspectLoader.source_to_code() is now a staticmethod.
  * [bpo-21424](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21424): Simplified and optimized heaqp.nlargest() and nmsmallest() to make fewer tuple comparisons.
  * [bpo-21396](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21396): Fix TextIOWrapper(…, write_through=True) to not force a flush() on the underlying binary stream. Patch by akira.
  * [bpo-18314](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18314): Unlink now removes junctions on Windows. Patch by Kim Gräsman
  * [bpo-21088](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21088): Bugfix for curses.window.addch() regression in 3.4.0. In porting to Argument Clinic, the first two arguments were reversed.
  * [bpo-21407](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21407): _decimal: The module now supports function signatures.
  * [bpo-10650](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10650): Remove the non-standard ‘watchexp’ parameter from the Decimal.quantize() method in the Python version. It had never been present in the C version.
  * [bpo-21469](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21469): Reduced the risk of false positives in robotparser by checking to make sure that robots.txt has been read or does not exist prior to returning True in can_fetch().
  * [bpo-19414](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19414): Have the OrderedDict mark deleted links as unusable. This gives an early failure if the link is deleted during iteration.
  * [bpo-21421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21421): Add __slots__ to the MappingViews ABC. Patch by Josh Rosenberg.
  * [bpo-21101](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21101): Eliminate double hashing in the C speed-up code for collections.Counter().
  * [bpo-21321](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21321): itertools.islice() now releases the reference to the source iterator when the slice is exhausted. Patch by Anton Afanasyev.
  * [bpo-21057](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21057): TextIOWrapper now allows the underlying binary stream’s read() or read1() method to return an arbitrary bytes-like object (such as a memoryview). Patch by Nikolaus Rath.
  * [bpo-20951](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20951): SSLSocket.send() now raises either SSLWantReadError or SSLWantWriteError on a non-blocking socket if the operation would block. Previously, it would return 0. Patch by Nikolaus Rath.
  * [bpo-13248](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13248): removed previously deprecated asyncore.dispatcher __getattr__ cheap inheritance hack.
  * [bpo-9815](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=9815): assertRaises now tries to clear references to local variables in the exception’s traceback.
  * [bpo-19940](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19940): ssl.cert_time_to_seconds() now interprets the given time string in the UTC timezone (as specified in RFC 5280), not the local timezone.
  * [bpo-13204](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13204): Calling sys.flags.__new__ would crash the interpreter, now it raises a TypeError.
  * [bpo-19385](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19385): Make operations on a closed dbm.dumb database always raise the same exception.
  * [bpo-21207](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21207): Detect when the os.urandom cached fd has been closed or replaced, and open it anew.
  * [bpo-21291](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21291): subprocess’s Popen.wait() is now thread safe so that multiple threads may be calling wait() or poll() on a Popen instance at the same time without losing the Popen.returncode value.
  * [bpo-21127](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21127): Path objects can now be instantiated from str subclass instances (such as `numpy.str_`).
  * [bpo-15002](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15002): urllib.response object to use _TemporaryFileWrapper (and _TemporaryFileCloser) facility. Provides a better way to handle file descriptor close.

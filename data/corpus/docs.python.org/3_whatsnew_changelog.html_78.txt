  * [gh-114099](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099): Added a Loader that can discover extension modules in an iOS-style Frameworks folder.
  * [gh-115775](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115775): Compiler populates the new `__static_attributes__` field on a class with the names of attributes of this class which are accessed through self.X from any function in its body.
  * [gh-115776](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115776): The array of values, the `PyDictValues` struct is now embedded in the object during allocation. This provides better performance in the common case, and does not degrade as much when the object’s `__dict__` is materialized.
  * [gh-108362](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108362): Implement an incremental cyclic garbage collector. By collecting the old generation in increments, there is no need for a full heap scan. This can hugely reduce maximum pause time for programs with large heaps.
Reduce the number of generations from three to two. The old generation is split into two spaces, “visited” and “pending”.
Collection happens in two steps:: * An increment is formed from the young generation and a small part of the pending space. * This increment is scanned and the survivors moved to the end of the visited space.
When the collecting space becomes empty, the two spaces are swapped.
  * [gh-109870](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109870): Dataclasses now calls [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") once per dataclass, instead of once per method being added. This can speed up dataclass creation by up to 20%.
  * [gh-97901](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97901): Mime type `text/rtf` is now supported by [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types.").
  * [bpo-24612](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24612): Improve the [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") that happens when ‘not’ appears after an operator. Patch by Pablo Galindo

Title: Panel Methods in Python Curses Library
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html
Summary: This section covers various methods available for the Panel class in the Python curses library, including how to manipulate panel visibility and position. Key methods discussed are `bottom()`, `hidden()`, `hide()`, `move(y, x)`, and `replace(win)`, with descriptions of their functionalities.
---

Panel.bottom()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.bottom "Link to this definition")
    
Push the panel to the bottom of the stack. 

Panel.hidden()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.hidden "Link to this definition")
    
Returns `True` if the panel is hidden (not visible), `False` otherwise. 

Panel.hide()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.hide "Link to this definition")
    
Hide the panel. This does not delete the object, it just makes the window on screen invisible. 

Panel.move(_y_ , _x_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.move "Link to this definition")
    
Move the panel to the screen coordinates `(y, x)`. 

Panel.replace(_win_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.replace "Link to this definition")
    
Change the window associated with the panel to the window _win_. 

Panel.set_userptr(_obj_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.set_userptr "Link to this definition")
    
Set the panel’s user pointer to _obj_. This is used to associate an arbitrary piece of data with the panel, and can be any Python object. 

Panel.show()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.show "Link to this definition")
    
Display the panel (which might have been hidden). 

Panel.top()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.top "Link to this definition")
    
Push panel to the top of the stack. 

Panel.userptr()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.userptr "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the user pointer for the panel. This might be any Python object. 

Panel.window()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.window "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the window object associated with the panel.

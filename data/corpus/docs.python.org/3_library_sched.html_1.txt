Title: Scheduler Objects in Python's sched Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html
Summary: This section describes the methods and attributes of `scheduler` instances in Python's sched module, focusing on the `enterabs` method which schedules a new event based on time and priority, detailing how to specify action and its arguments.

## Scheduler Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#scheduler-objects "Link to this heading")
[`scheduler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler "sched.scheduler") instances have the following methods and attributes: 

scheduler.enterabs(_time_ , _priority_ , _action_ , _argument =()_, _kwargs ={}_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enterabs "Link to this definition")
    
Schedule a new event. The _time_ argument should be a numeric type compatible with the return value of the _timefunc_ function passed to the constructor. Events scheduled for the same _time_ will be executed in the order of their _priority_. A lower number represents a higher priority.
Executing the event means executing `action(*argument, **kwargs)`. _argument_ is a sequence holding the positional arguments for _action_. _kwargs_ is a dictionary holding the keyword arguments for _action_.
Return value is an event which may be used for later cancellation of the event (see [`cancel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.cancel "sched.scheduler.cancel")).
Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.
Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added. 

scheduler.enter(_delay_ , _priority_ , _action_ , _argument =()_, _kwargs ={}_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enter "Link to this definition")
    
Schedule an event for _delay_ more time units. Other than the relative time, the other arguments, the effect and the return value are the same as those for [`enterabs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enterabs "sched.scheduler.enterabs").
Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.
Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added. 

scheduler.cancel(_event_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.cancel "Link to this definition")
    
Remove the event from the queue. If _event_ is not an event currently in the queue, this method will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). 

scheduler.empty()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.empty "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if the event queue is empty. 

scheduler.run(_blocking =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.run "Link to this definition")
    
Run all scheduled events. This method will wait (using the _delayfunc_ function passed to the constructor) for the next event, then execute it and so on until there are no more scheduled events.
If _blocking_ is false executes the scheduled events due to expire soonest (if any) and then return the deadline of the next scheduled call in the scheduler (if any).
Either _action_ or _delayfunc_ can raise an exception. In either case, the scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate the exception. If an exception is raised by _action_ , the event will not be attempted in future calls to [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.run "sched.scheduler.run").
If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available before the next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind. No events will be dropped; the calling code is responsible for canceling events which are no longer pertinent.
Changed in version 3.3: _blocking_ parameter was added. 

scheduler.queue[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.queue "Link to this definition")
    
Read-only attribute returning a list of upcoming events in the order they will be run. Each event is shown as a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) with the following fields: time, priority, action, argument, kwargs.

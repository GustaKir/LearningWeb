# `time` — Time access and conversions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time "Link to this heading")
This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime "datetime: Basic date and time types.") and [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program.") modules.
Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.
An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.
  * The _epoch_ is the point where the time starts, the return value of `time.gmtime(0)`. It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.


  * The term _seconds since the epoch_ refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.


  * The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the [epoch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#epoch) or far in the future. The cut-off point in the future is determined by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038.


  * Function [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") can parse 2-digit years when given `%y` format code. When 2-digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69–99 are mapped to 1969–1999, and values 0–68 are mapped to 2000–2068.


  * UTC is [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) and superseded [Greenwich Mean Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time) or GMT as the basis of international timekeeping. The acronym UTC is not a mistake but conforms to an earlier, language-agnostic naming scheme for time standards such as UT0, UT1, and UT2.

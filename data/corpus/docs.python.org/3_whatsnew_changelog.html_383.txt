Title: Python Changelog Highlights
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section highlights several bug fixes and optimizations made in Python, including improvements to signal handling in threads, support for weak references to `types.GenericAlias` objects, optimization of constant subexpressions in named expressions, and a fix for the LOAD_ATTR opcode cache regarding monkey-patching class attributes.

e the test deciding if the thread can handle signals is wrong.
  * [bpo-42332](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42332): [`types.GenericAlias`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.GenericAlias "types.GenericAlias") objects can now be the targets of weakrefs.
  * [bpo-42282](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42282): Optimise constant subexpressions that appear as part of named expressions (previously the AST optimiser did not descend into named expressions). Patch by Nick Coghlan.
  * [bpo-42266](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42266): Fixed a bug with the LOAD_ATTR opcode cache that was not respecting monkey-patching a class-level attribute to make it a descriptor. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [bpo-40077](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40077): Convert [`queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") to use heap types.
  * [bpo-42246](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42246): Improved accuracy of line tracing events and f_lineno attribute of Frame objects. See PEP 626 for details.
  * [bpo-40077](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40077): Convert [`mmap`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#module-mmap "mmap: Interface to memory-mapped files for Unix and Windows.") to use heap types.
  * [bpo-42233](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42233): Allow `GenericAlias` objects to use [union type expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-union). This allows expressions like `list[int] | dict[float, str]` where previously a `TypeError` would have been thrown. This also fixes union type expressions not de-duplicating `GenericAlias` objects.

  * [bpo-26131](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26131): The import system triggers a `ImportWarning` when it falls back to using `load_module()`.

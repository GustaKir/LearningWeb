Title: OS Exceptions in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html
Summary: This section covers several exceptions in Python related to the operating system, including EnvironmentError, IOError, and WindowsError. It details the OSError subclass exceptions like BlockingIOError, which occurs during non-blocking operations when an operation would block.

_exception_ EnvironmentError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EnvironmentError "Link to this definition")


_exception_ IOError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IOError "Link to this definition")


_exception_ WindowsError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#WindowsError "Link to this definition")
    
Only available on Windows.
### OS exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#os-exceptions "Link to this heading")
The following exceptions are subclasses of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), they get raised depending on the system error code. 

_exception_ BlockingIOError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g. socket) set for non-blocking operation. Corresponds to `errno` [`EAGAIN`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EAGAIN "errno.EAGAIN"), [`EALREADY`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EALREADY "errno.EALREADY"), [`EWOULDBLOCK`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EWOULDBLOCK "errno.EWOULDBLOCK") and [`EINPROGRESS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EINPROGRESS "errno.EINPROGRESS").
In addition to those of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), [`BlockingIOError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError "BlockingIOError") can have one more attribute: 

characters_written[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError.characters_written "Link to this definition")
    
An integer containing the number of characters written to the stream before it blocked. This attribute is available when using the buffered I/O classes from the [`io`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io "io: Core tools for working with streams.") module. 

_exception_ ChildProcessError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ChildProcessError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when an operation on a child process failed. Corresponds to `errno` [`ECHILD`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECHILD "errno.ECHILD"). 

_exception_ ConnectionError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "Link to this definition")
    
A base class for connection-related issues.
Subclasses are [`BrokenPipeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BrokenPipeError "BrokenPipeError"), [`ConnectionAbortedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionAbortedError "ConnectionAbortedError"), [`ConnectionRefusedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionRefusedError "ConnectionRefusedError") and [`ConnectionResetError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionResetError "ConnectionResetError"). 

_exception_ BrokenPipeError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BrokenPipeError "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when trying to write on a pipe while the other end has been closed, or trying to write on a socket which has been shutdown for writing. Corresponds to `errno` [`EPIPE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EPIPE "errno.EPIPE") and [`ESHUTDOWN`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ESHUTDOWN "errno.ESHUTDOWN"). 

_exception_ ConnectionAbortedError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionAbortedError "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection attempt is aborted by the peer. Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNABORTED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNABORTED "errno.ECONNABORTED"). 

_exception_ ConnectionRefusedError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionRefusedError "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection attempt is refused by the peer. Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNREFUSED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNREFUSED "errno.ECONNREFUSED"). 

_exception_ ConnectionResetError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionResetError "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection is reset by the peer. Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNRESET`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNRESET "errno.ECONNRESET").

  * [gh-95132](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95132): Fix a [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") regression where `*args` and `**kwds` were incorrectly relayed from [`connect()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect "sqlite3.connect") to the [`Connection`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection "sqlite3.Connection") factory. The regression was introduced in 3.11a1 with PR 24421 ([gh-85128](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85128)). Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
  * [gh-93157](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93157): Fix [`fileinput`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html#module-fileinput "fileinput: Loop over standard input or a list of files.") module didn’t support `errors` option when `inplace` is true.
  * [gh-91212](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91212): Fixed flickering of the turtle window when the tracer is turned off. Patch by Shin-myoung-serp.
  * [gh-95077](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95077): Add deprecation warning for enum `member.member` access (e.g. `Color.RED.BLUE`). Remove `EnumMeta.__getattr__`.
  * [gh-95109](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95109): Ensure that timeouts scheduled with [`asyncio.Timeout`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Timeout "asyncio.Timeout") that have already expired are delivered promptly.
  * [gh-95105](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95105): `wsgiref.types.InputStream.__iter__()` should return `Iterator[bytes]`, not `Iterable[bytes]`. Patch by Shantanu Jain.
  * [gh-95066](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95066): Replaced assert with exception in [`ast.parse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.parse "ast.parse"), when `feature_version` has an invalid major version. Patch by Shantanu Jain.
  * [gh-77617](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77617): Add [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") [command-line interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-cli). Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  * [gh-95005](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95005): Replace _PyAccu with _PyUnicodeWriter in JSON encoder and StringIO and remove the _PyAccu implementation.
  * [gh-90085](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90085): Remove `-c/--clock` and `-t/--time` CLI options of [`timeit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#module-timeit "timeit: Measure the execution time of small code snippets."). The options had been deprecated since Python 3.3 and the functionality was removed in Python 3.7. Patch by Shantanu Jain.
  * [gh-94857](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94857): Fix refleak in `_io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure`. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-94821](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94821): Fix binding of unix socket to empty address on Linux to use an available address from the abstract namespace, instead of “0”.
  * [gh-94736](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94736): Fix crash when deallocating an instance of a subclass of `_multiprocessing.SemLock`. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-81620](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81620): Add random.binomialvariate().
  * [gh-74116](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74116): Allow [`asyncio.StreamWriter.drain()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio.StreamWriter.drain "asyncio.StreamWriter.drain") to be awaited concurrently by multiple tasks. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-87822](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87822): When called with `capture_locals=True`, the [`traceback`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#module-traceback "traceback: Print or retrieve a stack traceback.") module functions swallow exceptions raised from calls to `repr()` on local variables of frames. This is in order to prioritize the original exception over rendering errors. An indication of the failure is printed in place of the missing value. (Patch by Simon-Martin Schroeder).
  * [gh-88050](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88050): Fix [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") subprocess transport to kill process cleanly when process is blocked and avoid `RuntimeError` when loop is closed. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-94637](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94637): `SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()` now releases the GIL around `SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths` call.

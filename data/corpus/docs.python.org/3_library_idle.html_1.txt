# IDLE — Python editor and shell[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#idle "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/idlelib/](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/idlelib/)
IDLE is Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment.
IDLE has the following features:
  * cross-platform: works mostly the same on Windows, Unix, and macOS
  * Python shell window (interactive interpreter) with colorizing of code input, output, and error messages
  * multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing, smart indent, call tips, auto completion, and other features
  * search within any window, replace within editor windows, and search through multiple files (grep)
  * debugger with persistent breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of global and local namespaces
  * configuration, browsers, and other dialogs


## Menus[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#menus "Link to this heading")
IDLE has two main window types, the Shell window and the Editor window. It is possible to have multiple editor windows simultaneously. On Windows and Linux, each has its own top menu. Each menu documented below indicates which window type it is associated with.
Output windows, such as used for Edit => Find in Files, are a subtype of editor window. They currently have the same top menu but a different default title and context menu.
On macOS, there is one application menu. It dynamically changes according to the window currently selected. It has an IDLE menu, and some entries described below are moved around to conform to Apple guidelines.
### File menu (Shell and Editor)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#file-menu-shell-and-editor "Link to this heading") 

New File
    
Create a new file editing window. 

Open…
    
Open an existing file with an Open dialog. 

Open Module…
    
Open an existing module (searches sys.path). 

Recent Files
    
Open a list of recent files. Click one to open it. 

Module Browser
    
Show functions, classes, and methods in the current Editor file in a tree structure. In the shell, open a module first. 

Path Browser
    
Show sys.path directories, modules, functions, classes and methods in a tree structure. 

Save
    
Save the current window to the associated file, if there is one. Windows that have been changed since being opened or last saved have a * before and after the window title. If there is no associated file, do Save As instead. 

Save As…
    
Save the current window with a Save As dialog. The file saved becomes the new associated file for the window. (If your file namager is set to hide extensions, the current extension will be omitted in the file name box. If the new filename has no ‘.’, ‘.py’ and ‘.txt’ will be added for Python and text files, except that on macOS Aqua,’.py’ is added for all files.) 

Save Copy As…
    
Save the current window to different file without changing the associated file. (See Save As note above about filename extensions.) 

Print Window
    
Print the current window to the default printer. 

Close Window
    
Close the current window (if an unsaved editor, ask to save; if an unsaved Shell, ask to quit execution). Calling `exit()` or `close()` in the Shell window also closes Shell. If this is the only window, also exit IDLE. 

Exit IDLE
    
Close all windows and quit IDLE (ask to save unsaved edit windows).
### Edit menu (Shell and Editor)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#edit-menu-shell-and-editor "Link to this heading") 

Undo
    
Undo the last change to the current window. A maximum of 1000 changes may be undone. 

Redo
    
Redo the last undone change to the current window. 

Select All
    
Select the entire contents of the current window. 

Cut
    
Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard; then delete the selection. 

Copy
    
Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id699 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-21277](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21277): Don’t try to link _ctypes with a ffi_convenience library.
  * [bpo-26884](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26884): Fix linking extension modules for cross builds. Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-26932](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26932): Fixed support of RTLD_* constants defined as enum values, not via macros (in particular on Android). Patch by Chi Hsuan Yen.
  * [bpo-22359](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22359): Disable the rules for running _freeze_importlib and pgen when cross-compiling. The output of these programs is normally saved with the source code anyway, and is still regenerated when doing a native build. Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-21668](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21668): Link audioop, _datetime, _ctypes_test modules to libm, except on Mac OS X. Patch written by Chi Hsuan Yen.
  * [bpo-25702](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25702): A –with-lto configure option has been added that will enable link time optimizations at build time during a make profile-opt. Some compilers and toolchains are known to not produce stable code when using LTO, be sure to test things thoroughly before relying on it. It can provide a few % speed up over profile-opt alone.
  * [bpo-26624](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26624): Adds validation of ucrtbase[d].dll version with warning for old versions.
  * [bpo-17603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17603): Avoid error about nonexistent fileblocks.o file by using a lower-level check for st_blocks in struct stat.
  * [bpo-26079](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26079): Fixing the build output folder for tix-8.4.3.6. Patch by Bjoern Thiel.
  * [bpo-26465](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26465): Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2g.
  * [bpo-25348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25348): Added `--pgo` and `--pgo-job` arguments to `PCbuild\build.bat` for building with Profile-Guided Optimization. The old `PCbuild\build_pgo.bat` script is removed.
  * [bpo-25827](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25827): Add support for building with ICC to `configure`, including a new `--with-icc` flag.
  * [bpo-25696](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25696): Fix installation of Python on UNIX with make -j9.
  * [bpo-24986](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24986): It is now possible to build Python on Windows without errors when external libraries are not available.
  * [bpo-24421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24421): Compile Modules/_math.c once, before building extensions. Previously it could fail to compile properly if the math and cmath builds were concurrent.
  * [bpo-26465](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26465): Update OS X 10.5+ 32-bit-only installer to build and link with OpenSSL 1.0.2g.
  * [bpo-26268](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26268): Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2f.
  * [bpo-25136](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25136): Support Apple Xcode 7’s new textual SDK stub libraries.
  * [bpo-24324](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24324): Do not enable unreachable code warnings when using gcc as the option does not work correctly in older versions of gcc and has been silently removed as of gcc-4.5.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id700 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-27053](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27053): Updates make_zip.py to correctly generate library ZIP file.
  * [bpo-26268](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26268): Update the prepare_ssl.py script to handle OpenSSL releases that don’t include the contents of the include directory (that is, 1.0.2e and later).
  * [bpo-26071](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26071): bdist_wininst created binaries fail to start and find 32bit Python
  * [bpo-26073](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26073): Update the list of magic numbers in launcher
  * [bpo-26065](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26065): Excludes venv from library when generating embeddable distro.
  * [bpo-25022](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25022): Removed very outdated PC/example_nt/ directory.

Title: Overview of the rlcompleter Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/rlcompleter.html
Summary: The `rlcompleter` module aids in Python's interactive mode, automatically importing under normal conditions. It features the `Completer` class, which allows for custom completion purposes even on systems without `readline`. The Completer offers a method called `complete`.

```

The `rlcompleter` module is designed for use with Python’s [interactive mode](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#tut-interactive). Unless Python is run with the [`-S`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-S) option, the module is automatically imported and configured (see [Readline configuration](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#rlcompleter-config)).
On platforms without [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)"), the [`Completer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/rlcompleter.html#rlcompleter.Completer "rlcompleter.Completer") class defined by this module can still be used for custom purposes. 

_class_ rlcompleter.Completer[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/rlcompleter.html#rlcompleter.Completer "Link to this definition")
    
Completer objects have the following method: 

complete(_text_ , _state_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/rlcompleter.html#rlcompleter.Completer.complete "Link to this definition")
    
Return the next possible completion for _text_.
When called by the [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)") module, this method is called successively with `state == 0, 1, 2, ...` until the method returns `None`.
If called for _text_ that doesn’t include a period character (`'.'`), it will complete from names currently defined in [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``."), [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") and keywords (as defined by the [`keyword`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/keyword.html#module-keyword "keyword: Test whether a string is a keyword in Python.") module).
If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything without obvious side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate calls to [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__")) up to the last part, and find matches for the rest via the [`dir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir "dir") function. Any exception raised during the evaluation of the expression is caught, silenced and [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") is returned.

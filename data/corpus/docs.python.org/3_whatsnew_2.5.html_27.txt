Title: Python 2.5 Changes Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html
Summary: This section highlights key changes in Python 2.5, including the ability to specify stack frames for warnings, the successful compilation of CPython with a C++ compiler, and the removal of the undocumented `PyRange_New()` function, along with a suggested replacement approach for its use.
---

ets you specify the number of stack frames separating this function and the caller. A _stacklevel_ of 1 is the function calling [`PyErr_WarnEx()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/exceptions.html#c.PyErr_WarnEx "PyErr_WarnEx"), 2 is the function above that, and so forth. (Added by Neal Norwitz.)
  * The CPython interpreter is still written in C, but the code can now be compiled with a C++ compiler without errors. (Implemented by Anthony Baxter, Martin von Löwis, Skip Montanaro.)
  * The `PyRange_New()` function was removed. It was never documented, never used in the core code, and had dangerously lax error checking. In the unlikely case that your extensions were using it, you can replace it by something like the following:
```
range = PyObject_CallFunction((PyObject*) &PyRange_Type, "lll",
               start, stop, step);

```



### Port-Specific Changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html#port-specific-changes "Link to this heading")
  * MacOS X (10.3 and higher): dynamic loading of modules now uses the `dlopen()` function instead of MacOS-specific functions.
  * MacOS X: an `--enable-universalsdk` switch was added to the **configure** script that compiles the interpreter as a universal binary able to run on both PowerPC and Intel processors. (Contributed by Ronald Oussoren; [bpo-2573](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=2573).)
  * Windows: `.dll` is no longer supported as a filename extension for extension modules. `.pyd` is now the only filename extension that will be searched for.

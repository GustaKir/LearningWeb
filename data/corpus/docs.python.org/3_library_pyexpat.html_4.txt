Title: XML Parser Buffering Options
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html
Summary: The `xmlparser.buffer_text` attribute, when set to true, enhances performance by buffering textual content to minimize calls to the `CharacterDataHandler` callback, preventing chunking at every line ending. By default, this attribute is false and can be modified at any time. Additionally, the `xmlparser.buffer_used` attribute tracks the use of the buffer.

xmlparser.buffer_text[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_text "Link to this definition")
    
Setting this to true causes the `xmlparser` object to buffer textual content returned by Expat to avoid multiple calls to the [`CharacterDataHandler()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.CharacterDataHandler "xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.CharacterDataHandler") callback whenever possible. This can improve performance substantially since Expat normally breaks character data into chunks at every line ending. This attribute is false by default, and may be changed at any time. Note that when it is false, data that does not contain newlines may be chunked too. 

xmlparser.buffer_used[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_used "Link to this definition")
    
If [`buffer_text`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_text "xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_text") is enabled, the number of bytes stored in the buffer. These bytes represent UTF-8 encoded text. This attribute has no meaningful interpretation when [`buffer_text`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_text "xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.buffer_text") is false. 

xmlparser.ordered_attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.ordered_attributes "Link to this definition")
    
Setting this attribute to a non-zero integer causes the attributes to be reported as a list rather than a dictionary. The attributes are presented in the order found in the document text. For each attribute, two list entries are presented: the attribute name and the attribute value. (Older versions of this module also used this format.) By default, this attribute is false; it may be changed at any time. 

xmlparser.specified_attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.specified_attributes "Link to this definition")
    
If set to a non-zero integer, the parser will report only those attributes which were specified in the document instance and not those which were derived from attribute declarations. Applications which set this need to be especially careful to use what additional information is available from the declarations as needed to comply with the standards for the behavior of XML processors. By default, this attribute is false; it may be changed at any time.
The following attributes contain values relating to the most recent error encountered by an `xmlparser` object, and will only have correct values once a call to `Parse()` or `ParseFile()` has raised an [`xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError "xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError") exception. 

xmlparser.ErrorByteIndex[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.ErrorByteIndex "Link to this definition")
    
Byte index at which an error occurred. 

xmlparser.ErrorCode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.ErrorCode "Link to this definition")
    
Numeric code specifying the problem. This value can be passed to the [`ErrorString()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.ErrorString "xml.parsers.expat.ErrorString") function, or compared to one of the constants defined in the `errors` object. 

xmlparser.ErrorColumnNumber[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.ErrorColumnNumber "Link to this definition")
    
Column number at which an error occurred. 

xmlparser.ErrorLineNumber[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.ErrorLineNumber "Link to this definition")
    
Line number at which an error occurred.
The following attributes contain values relating to the current parse location in an `xmlparser` object. During a callback reporting a parse event they indicate the location of the first of the sequence of characters that generated the event. When called outside of a callback, the position indicated will be just past the last parse event (regardless of whether there was an associated callback). 

xmlparser.CurrentByteIndex[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.CurrentByteIndex "Link to this definition")
    
Current byte index in the parser input. 

xmlparser.CurrentColumnNumber[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyexpat.html#xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.CurrentColumnNumber "Link to this definition")
    
Current column number in the parser input.

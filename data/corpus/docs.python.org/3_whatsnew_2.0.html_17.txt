## IDLE Improvements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html#idle-improvements "Link to this heading")
IDLE is the official Python cross-platform IDE, written using Tkinter. Python 2.0 includes IDLE 0.6, which adds a number of new features and improvements. A partial list:
  * UI improvements and optimizations, especially in the area of syntax highlighting and auto-indentation.
  * The class browser now shows more information, such as the top level functions in a module.
  * Tab width is now a user settable option. When opening an existing Python file, IDLE automatically detects the indentation conventions, and adapts.
  * There is now support for calling browsers on various platforms, used to open the Python documentation in a browser.
  * IDLE now has a command line, which is largely similar to the vanilla Python interpreter.
  * Call tips were added in many places.
  * IDLE can now be installed as a package.
  * In the editor window, there is now a line/column bar at the bottom.
  * Three new keystroke commands: Check module (`Alt`-`F5`), Import module (`F5`) and Run script (`Ctrl`-`F5`).


## Deleted and Deprecated Modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html#deleted-and-deprecated-modules "Link to this heading")
A few modules have been dropped because they’re obsolete, or because there are now better ways to do the same thing. The `stdwin` module is gone; it was for a platform-independent windowing toolkit that’s no longer developed.
A number of modules have been moved to the `lib-old` subdirectory: `cmp`, `cmpcache`, `dircmp`, `dump`, `find`, `grep`, `packmail`, `poly`, `util`, `whatsound`, `zmod`. If you have code which relies on a module that’s been moved to `lib-old`, you can simply add that directory to `sys.path` to get them back, but you’re encouraged to update any code that uses these modules.

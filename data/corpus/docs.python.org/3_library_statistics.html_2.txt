## Averages and measures of central location[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#averages-and-measures-of-central-location "Link to this heading")
These functions calculate an average or typical value from a population or sample.
[`mean()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean "statistics.mean") | Arithmetic mean (“average”) of data.  
---|---  
[`fmean()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.fmean "statistics.fmean") | Fast, floating-point arithmetic mean, with optional weighting.  
[`geometric_mean()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.geometric_mean "statistics.geometric_mean") | Geometric mean of data.  
[`harmonic_mean()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.harmonic_mean "statistics.harmonic_mean") | Harmonic mean of data.  
[`kde()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.kde "statistics.kde") | Estimate the probability density distribution of the data.  
[`kde_random()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.kde_random "statistics.kde_random") | Random sampling from the PDF generated by kde().  
[`median()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median "statistics.median") | Median (middle value) of data.  
[`median_low()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median_low "statistics.median_low") | Low median of data.  
[`median_high()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median_high "statistics.median_high") | High median of data.  
[`median_grouped()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median_grouped "statistics.median_grouped") | Median (50th percentile) of grouped data.  
[`mode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mode "statistics.mode") | Single mode (most common value) of discrete or nominal data.  
[`multimode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.multimode "statistics.multimode") | List of modes (most common values) of discrete or nominal data.  
[`quantiles()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.quantiles "statistics.quantiles") | Divide data into intervals with equal probability.  
## Measures of spread[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#measures-of-spread "Link to this heading")
These functions calculate a measure of how much the population or sample tends to deviate from the typical or average values.
[`pstdev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.pstdev "statistics.pstdev") | Population standard deviation of data.  
---|---  
[`pvariance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.pvariance "statistics.pvariance") | Population variance of data.  
[`stdev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.stdev "statistics.stdev") | Sample standard deviation of data.  
[`variance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.variance "statistics.variance") | Sample variance of data.  
## Statistics for relations between two inputs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics-for-relations-between-two-inputs "Link to this heading")
These functions calculate statistics regarding relations between two inputs.
[`covariance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.covariance "statistics.covariance") | Sample covariance for two variables.  
---|---  
[`correlation()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.correlation "statistics.correlation") | Pearson and Spearman’s correlation coefficients.  
[`linear_regression()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.linear_regression "statistics.linear_regression") | Slope and intercept for simple linear regression.  
## Function details[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#function-details "Link to this heading")
Note: The functions do not require the data given to them to be sorted. However, for reading convenience, most of the examples show sorted sequences. 

statistics.mean(_data_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean "Link to this definition")
    
Return the sample arithmetic mean of _data_ which can be a sequence or iterable.
The arithmetic mean is the sum of the data divided by the number of data points. It is commonly called “the average”, although it is only one of many different mathematical averages. It is a measure of the central location of the data.
If _data_ is empty, [`StatisticsError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.StatisticsError "statistics.StatisticsError") will be raised.

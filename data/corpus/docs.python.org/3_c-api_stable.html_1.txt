Title: C API Stability Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html
Summary: This section discusses the stability of the Python C API, highlighting that names prefixed with an underscore are private APIs subject to change without notice. It outlines the 'Unstable C API', which can change between minor releases, and indicates that it is mainly for specialized tools. Users of this API should be prepared for adjustments with each change.
---

These are discussed in more detail below.
Names prefixed by an underscore, such as `_Py_InternalState`, are private API that can change without notice even in patch releases. If you need to use this API, consider reaching out to [CPython developers](https://discuss.python.org/c/core-dev/c-api/30) to discuss adding public API for your use case.
## Unstable C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#unstable-c-api "Link to this heading")
Any API named with the `PyUnstable` prefix exposes CPython implementation details, and may change in every minor release (e.g. from 3.9 to 3.10) without any deprecation warnings. However, it will not change in a bugfix release (e.g. from 3.10.0 to 3.10.1).
It is generally intended for specialized, low-level tools like debuggers.
Projects that use this API are expected to follow CPython development and spend extra effort adjusting to changes.
## Stable Application Binary Interface[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable-application-binary-interface "Link to this heading")
For simplicity, this document talks about _extensions_ , but the Limited API and Stable ABI work the same way for all uses of the API – for example, embedding Python.
### Limited C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-c-api "Link to this heading")
Python 3.2 introduced the _Limited API_ , a subset of Python’s C API. Extensions that only use the Limited API can be compiled once and be loaded on multiple versions of Python. Contents of the Limited API are [listed below](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-api-list).

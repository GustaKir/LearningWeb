Title: File Mode Conversion Utility in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html
Summary: The `stat.filemode(_mode_)` function converts a file's mode to a human-readable string format, such as '-rwxrwxrwx'. Introduced in version 3.3 and modified in version 3.4 to support additional symbolic constants. The function uses indexes from the 10-tuple output of `os.stat()`, `os.fstat()`, or `os.lstat()`.

```

An additional utility function is provided to convert a file’s mode in a human readable string: 

stat.filemode(_mode_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.filemode "Link to this definition")
    
Convert a file’s mode to a string of the form ‘-rwxrwxrwx’.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.4: The function supports [`S_IFDOOR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFDOOR "stat.S_IFDOOR"), [`S_IFPORT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFPORT "stat.S_IFPORT") and [`S_IFWHT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFWHT "stat.S_IFWHT").
All the variables below are simply symbolic indexes into the 10-tuple returned by [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat"), [`os.fstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstat "os.fstat") or [`os.lstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.lstat "os.lstat"). 

stat.ST_MODE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_MODE "Link to this definition")
    
Inode protection mode. 

stat.ST_INO[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_INO "Link to this definition")
    
Inode number. 

stat.ST_DEV[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_DEV "Link to this definition")
    
Device inode resides on. 

stat.ST_NLINK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_NLINK "Link to this definition")
    
Number of links to the inode. 

stat.ST_UID[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_UID "Link to this definition")
    
User id of the owner. 

stat.ST_GID[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_GID "Link to this definition")
    
Group id of the owner. 

stat.ST_SIZE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_SIZE "Link to this definition")
    
Size in bytes of a plain file; amount of data waiting on some special files. 

stat.ST_ATIME[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_ATIME "Link to this definition")
    
Time of last access. 

stat.ST_MTIME[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_MTIME "Link to this definition")
    
Time of last modification. 

stat.ST_CTIME[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_CTIME "Link to this definition")
    
The “ctime” as reported by the operating system. On some systems (like Unix) is the time of the last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation time (see platform documentation for details).
The interpretation of “file size” changes according to the file type. For plain files this is the size of the file in bytes. For FIFOs and sockets under most flavors of Unix (including Linux in particular), the “size” is the number of bytes waiting to be read at the time of the call to [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat"), [`os.fstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstat "os.fstat"), or [`os.lstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.lstat "os.lstat"); this can sometimes be useful, especially for polling one of these special files after a non-blocking open. The meaning of the size field for other character and block devices varies more, depending on the implementation of the underlying system call.
The variables below define the flags used in the [`ST_MODE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.ST_MODE "stat.ST_MODE") field.
Use of the functions above is more portable than use of the first set of flags: 

stat.S_IFSOCK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFSOCK "Link to this definition")
    
Socket. 

stat.S_IFLNK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFLNK "Link to this definition")
    
Symbolic link. 

stat.S_IFREG[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFREG "Link to this definition")
    
Regular file. 

stat.S_IFBLK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFBLK "Link to this definition")
    
Block device. 

stat.S_IFDIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFDIR "Link to this definition")
    
Directory. 

stat.S_IFCHR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFCHR "Link to this definition")

Door.
Added in version 3.4. 

stat.S_IFPORT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFPORT "Link to this definition")
    
Event port.
Added in version 3.4.

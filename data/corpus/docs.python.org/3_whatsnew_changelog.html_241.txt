Title: Python Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This update includes various contributions by Victor Stinner, such as the addition of a `taskName` attribute to the logging module for asyncio tasks, improvements to the `shutil.make_archive()` function to avoid changing the current working directory, and the restoration of the `re.template()` function along with its flags, which are now deprecated.

Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-91513](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91513): Added `taskName` attribute to [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") module for use with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") tasks.
  * [gh-74696](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74696): [`shutil.make_archive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.make_archive "shutil.make_archive") no longer temporarily changes the current working directory during creation of standard `.zip` or tar archives.
  * [gh-92728](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92728): The `re.template()` function and the corresponding `re.TEMPLATE` and `re.T` flags are restored after they were removed in 3.11.0b1, but they are now deprecated, so they might be removed from Python 3.13.
  * [gh-93033](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93033): Search in some strings (platform dependent i.e [U+0xFFFF, U+0x0100] on Windows or [U+0xFFFFFFFF, U+0x00010000] on Linux 64-bit) are now up to 10 times faster.
  * [gh-89973](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89973): Fix `re.error` raised in [`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#module-fnmatch "fnmatch: Unix shell style filename pattern matching.") if the pattern contains a character range with upper bound lower than lower bound (e.g. `[c-a]`). Now such ranges are interpreted as empty ranges.
  * [gh-93044](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93044): No longer convert the database argument of [`sqlite3.connect()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect "sqlite3.connect") to bytes before passing it to the factory.
  * [gh-93010](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93010): In a very special case, the email package tried to append the nonexistent `InvalidHeaderError` to the defect list. It should have been `InvalidHeaderDefect`.
  * [gh-92986](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92986): Fix [`ast.unparse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.unparse "ast.unparse") when `ImportFrom.level` is `None`
  * [gh-92932](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92932): Now [`dis()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#dis.dis "dis.dis") and [`get_instructions()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#dis.get_instructions "dis.get_instructions") handle operand values for instructions prefixed by `EXTENDED_ARG_QUICK`. Patch by Sam Gross and Donghee Na.
  * [gh-92675](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92675): Fix `venv.ensure_directories()` to accept [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path") arguments in addition to [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") paths. Patch by David Foster.
  * [gh-87901](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87901): Removed the `encoding` argument from [`os.popen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen "os.popen") that was added in 3.11b1.
  * [gh-91922](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91922): Fix function `sqlite.connect()` and the `sqlite.Connection` constructor on non-UTF-8 locales.

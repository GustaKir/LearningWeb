Title: Python on Windows: Using SWIG and Managing Interpreter Windows
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html
Summary: The document discusses issues related to using SWIG with Python on Windows, specifically its `%typemap` command, and advises against using a standalone Python shell script within Windows applications. Instead, it suggests creating a 'native' interpreter window linked to the application's system for better integration. Additionally, it touches on the FAQ recommendation against using tabs in Python source code.

It may be possible to use SWIG’s `%typemap` command to make the change automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (I’m a complete SWIG newbie).
  6. Using a Python shell script to put up a Python interpreter window from inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be independent of your app’s windowing system. Rather, you (or the wxPythonWindow class) should create a “native” interpreter window. It is easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter. You can redirect Python’s i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need is a Python object (defined in your extension module) that contains read() and write() methods.


## [How do I keep editors from inserting tabs into my Python source?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#id8)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-keep-editors-from-inserting-tabs-into-my-python-source "Link to this heading")
The FAQ does not recommend using tabs, and the Python style guide, [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), recommends 4 spaces for distributed Python code; this is also the Emacs python-mode default.
Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea. MSVC is no different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces: Take Tools ‣ Options ‣ Tabs, and for file type “Default” set “Tab size” and “Indent size” to 4, and select the “Insert spaces” radio button.
Python raises [`IndentationError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndentationError "IndentationError") or [`TabError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TabError "TabError") if mixed tabs and spaces are causing problems in leading whitespace. You may also run the [`tabnanny`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tabnanny.html#module-tabnanny "tabnanny: Tool for detecting white space related problems in Python source files in a directory tree.") module to check a directory tree in batch mode.

Use the [`msvcrt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/msvcrt.html#module-msvcrt "msvcrt: Miscellaneous useful routines from the MS VC++ runtime. \(Windows\)") module. This is a standard Windows-specific extension module. It defines a function `kbhit()` which checks whether a keyboard hit is present, and `getch()` which gets one character without echoing it.

This can occur on Python 3.5 and later when using Windows 8.1 or earlier without all updates having been installed. First ensure your operating system is supported and is up to date, and if that does not resolve the issue, visit the [Microsoft support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3118401/) for guidance on manually installing the C Runtime update.

Title: Introducing the Curses Textpad Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html
Summary: The `curses.textpad` module provides a text box with Emacs-like keybindings for input editing. The `Textbox` class offers methods for editing with input validation and gathering results, as shown in the example code for creating a text input field.

```

The [`curses.textpad`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses.textpad "curses.textpad: Emacs-like input editing in a curses window.") module supplies a text box that supports an Emacs-like set of keybindings. Various methods of the [`Textbox`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.textpad.Textbox "curses.textpad.Textbox") class support editing with input validation and gathering the edit results either with or without trailing spaces. Here’s an example:
```
importcurses
fromcurses.textpadimport Textbox, rectangle
defmain(stdscr):
  stdscr.addstr(0, 0, "Enter IM message: (hit Ctrl-G to send)")
  editwin = curses.newwin(5,30, 2,1)
  rectangle(stdscr, 1,0, 1+5+1, 1+30+1)
  stdscr.refresh()
  box = Textbox(editwin)
  # Let the user edit until Ctrl-G is struck.
  box.edit()
  # Get resulting contents
  message = box.gather()

```

See the library documentation on [`curses.textpad`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses.textpad "curses.textpad: Emacs-like input editing in a curses window.") for more details.
## For More Information[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html#for-more-information "Link to this heading")
This HOWTO doesn’t cover some advanced topics, such as reading the contents of the screen or capturing mouse events from an xterm instance, but the Python library page for the [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") module is now reasonably complete. You should browse it next.
If you’re in doubt about the detailed behavior of the curses functions, consult the manual pages for your curses implementation, whether it’s ncurses or a proprietary Unix vendor’s. The manual pages will document any quirks, and provide complete lists of all the functions, attributes, and [ACS_*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses-acs-codes) characters available to you.
Because the curses API is so large, some functions aren’t supported in the Python interface. Often this isn’t because they’re difficult to implement, but because no one has needed them yet. Also, Python doesn’t yet support the menu library associated with ncurses. Patches adding support for these would be welcome; see [the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/) to learn more about submitting patches to Python.

# `bdb` — Debugger framework[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#module-bdb "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/bdb.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/bdb.py)
The [`bdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#module-bdb "bdb: Debugger framework.") module handles basic debugger functions, like setting breakpoints or managing execution via the debugger.
The following exception is defined: 

_exception_ bdb.BdbQuit[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.BdbQuit "Link to this definition")
    
Exception raised by the [`Bdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Bdb "bdb.Bdb") class for quitting the debugger.
The [`bdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#module-bdb "bdb: Debugger framework.") module also defines two classes: 

_class_ bdb.Breakpoint(_self_ , _file_ , _line_ , _temporary =False_, _cond =None_, _funcname =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint "Link to this definition")
    
This class implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and (re-)enabling, and conditionals.
Breakpoints are indexed by number through a list called [`bpbynumber`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.bpbynumber "bdb.Breakpoint.bpbynumber") and by `(file, line)` pairs through [`bplist`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.bplist "bdb.Breakpoint.bplist"). The former points to a single instance of class [`Breakpoint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint "bdb.Breakpoint"). The latter points to a list of such instances since there may be more than one breakpoint per line.
When creating a breakpoint, its associated [`file name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.file "bdb.Breakpoint.file") should be in canonical form. If a [`funcname`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.funcname "bdb.Breakpoint.funcname") is defined, a breakpoint [`hit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.hits "bdb.Breakpoint.hits") will be counted when the first line of that function is executed. A [`conditional`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.cond "bdb.Breakpoint.cond") breakpoint always counts a [`hit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.hits "bdb.Breakpoint.hits").
[`Breakpoint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint "bdb.Breakpoint") instances have the following methods: 

deleteMe()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.deleteMe "Link to this definition")
    
Delete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file/line. If it is the last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes the entry for the file/line. 

enable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.enable "Link to this definition")
    
Mark the breakpoint as enabled. 

disable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bdb.html#bdb.Breakpoint.disable "Link to this definition")
    
Mark the breakpoint as disabled.

Title: Virtual Environment Builder Methods
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
Summary: This section describes two methods in the virtual environment builder: `post_setup()` for overriding to pre-install packages or perform post-creation steps, and `install_scripts()` for assisting in the installation of custom scripts into the virtual environment from specified directories.
---

post_setup(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup "Link to this definition")
    
A placeholder method which can be overridden in third party implementations to pre-install packages in the virtual environment or perform other post-creation steps. 

install_scripts(_context_ , _path_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "Link to this definition")
    
This method can be called from [`setup_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts") or [`post_setup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup "venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup") in subclasses to assist in installing custom scripts into the virtual environment.
_path_ is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories `common`, `posix`, `nt`; each containing scripts destined for the `bin` directory in the environment. The contents of `common` and the directory corresponding to [`os.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name "os.name") are copied after some text replacement of placeholders:
  * `__VENV_DIR__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment directory.
  * `__VENV_NAME__` is replaced with the environment name (final path segment of environment directory).
  * `__VENV_PROMPT__` is replaced with the prompt (the environment name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)
  * `__VENV_BIN_NAME__` is replaced with the name of the bin directory (either `bin` or `Scripts`).
  * `__VENV_PYTHON__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment’s executable.


The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment is being upgraded). 

create_git_ignore_file(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create_git_ignore_file "Link to this definition")
    
Creates a `.gitignore` file within the virtual environment that causes the entire directory to be ignored by the Git source control manager.
Added in version 3.13.
Changed in version 3.7.2: Windows now uses redirector scripts for `python[w].exe` instead of copying the actual binaries. In 3.7.2 only [`setup_python()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python") does nothing unless running from a build in the source tree.
Changed in version 3.7.3: Windows copies the redirector scripts as part of [`setup_python()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python") instead of [`setup_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts"). This was not the case in 3.7.2. When using symlinks, the original executables will be linked.
There is also a module-level convenience function: 

venv.create(_env_dir_ , _system_site_packages =False_, _clear =False_, _symlinks =False_, _with_pip =False_, _prompt =None_, _upgrade_deps =False_, _*_ , _scm_ignore_files =frozenset()_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.create "Link to this definition")
    
Create an [`EnvBuilder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "venv.EnvBuilder") with the given keyword arguments, and call its [`create()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create "venv.EnvBuilder.create") method with the _env_dir_ argument.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.4: Added the _with_pip_ parameter
Changed in version 3.6: Added the _prompt_ parameter
Changed in version 3.9: Added the _upgrade_deps_ parameter
Changed in version 3.13: Added the _scm_ignore_files_ parameter
## An example of extending `EnvBuilder`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#an-example-of-extending-envbuilder "Link to this heading")
The following script shows how to extend [`EnvBuilder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "venv.EnvBuilder") by implementing a subclass which installs setuptools and pip into a created virtual environment:

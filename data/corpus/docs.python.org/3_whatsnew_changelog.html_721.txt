Title: Test Additions and Updates in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section outlines various test enhancements in Python, including added tests for the turtle module, multiprocessing thread pool, pickling of mutable sequences, and new mechanisms to prevent ResourceWarnings, among other updates to existing tests.

### Tests[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id733 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-21916](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21916): Added tests for the turtle module. Patch by ingrid, Gregory Loyse and Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-26523](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26523): The multiprocessing thread pool (multiprocessing.dummy.Pool) was untested.
  * [bpo-26015](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26015): Added new tests for pickling iterators of mutable sequences.
  * [bpo-26325](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26325): Added test.support.check_no_resource_warning() to check that no ResourceWarning is emitted.
  * [bpo-25940](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25940): Changed test_ssl to use self-signed.pythontest.net. This avoids relying on svn.python.org, which recently changed root certificate.
  * [bpo-25616](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25616): Tests for OrderedDict are extracted from test_collections into separate file test_ordered_dict.
  * [bpo-26583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26583): Skip test_timestamp_overflow in test_import if bytecode files cannot be written.


### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id734 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-26884](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26884): Fix linking extension modules for cross builds. Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-22359](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22359): Disable the rules for running _freeze_importlib and pgen when cross-compiling. The output of these programs is normally saved with the source code anyway, and is still regenerated when doing a native build. Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-27229](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27229): Fix the cross-compiling pgen rule for in-tree builds. Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-21668](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21668): Link audioop, _datetime, _ctypes_test modules to libm, except on Mac OS X. Patch written by Xavier de Gaye.
  * [bpo-25702](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25702): A –with-lto configure option has been added that will enable link time optimizations at build time during a make profile-opt. Some compilers and toolchains are known to not produce stable code when using LTO, be sure to test things thoroughly before relying on it. It can provide a few % speed up over profile-opt alone.
  * [bpo-26624](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26624): Adds validation of ucrtbase[d].dll version with warning for old versions.
  * [bpo-17603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17603): Avoid error about nonexistent fileblocks.o file by using a lower-level check for st_blocks in struct stat.
  * [bpo-26079](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26079): Fixing the build output folder for tix-8.4.3.6. Patch by Bjoern Thiel.
  * [bpo-26465](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26465): Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2g.
  * [bpo-24421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24421): Compile Modules/_math.c once, before building extensions. Previously it could fail to compile properly if the math and cmath builds were concurrent.
  * [bpo-25348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25348): Added `--pgo` and `--pgo-job` arguments to `PCbuild\build.bat` for building with Profile-Guided Optimization. The old `PCbuild\build_pgo.bat` script is now deprecated, and simply calls `PCbuild\build.bat --pgo %*`.
  * [bpo-25827](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25827): Add support for building with ICC to `configure`, including a new `--with-icc` flag.
  * [bpo-25696](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25696): Fix installation of Python on UNIX with make -j9.
  * [bpo-26930](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26930): Update OS X 10.5+ 32-bit-only installer to build and link with OpenSSL 1.0.2h.
  * [bpo-26268](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26268): Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2f.
  * [bpo-25136](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25136): Support Apple Xcode 7’s new textual SDK stub libraries.
  * [bpo-24324](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24324): Do not enable unreachable code warnings when using gcc as the option does not work correctly in older versions of gcc and has been silently removed as of gcc-4.5.

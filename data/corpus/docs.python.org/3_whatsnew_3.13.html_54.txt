Title: Build Changes in Python 3.13
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html
Summary: Python 3.13 introduces several changes to platform support. Notably, `arm64-apple-ios` and `arm64-apple-ios-simulator` are now classified as PEP 11 tier 3 platforms. Additionally, `aarch64-linux-android` and `x86_64-linux-android` are also tier 3 platforms. Meanwhile, `wasm32-wasi` is upgraded to a PEP 11 tier 2 platform.

## Build Changes[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#build-changes "Link to this heading")
  * `arm64-apple-ios` and `arm64-apple-ios-simulator` are both now [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 3 platforms. ([PEP 730](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-platform-support) written and implementation contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in [gh-114099](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099).)
  * `aarch64-linux-android` and `x86_64-linux-android` are both now [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 3 platforms. ([PEP 738](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-platform-support) written and implementation contributed by Malcolm Smith in [gh-116622](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622).)
  * `wasm32-wasi` is now a [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 2 platform. (Contributed by Brett Cannon in [gh-115192](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115192).)
  * `wasm32-emscripten` is no longer a [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) supported platform. (Contributed by Brett Cannon in [gh-115192](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115192).)
  * Building CPython now requires a compiler with support for the C11 atomic library, GCC built-in atomic functions, or MSVC interlocked intrinsics.
  * Autoconf 2.71 and aclocal 1.16.5 are now required to regenerate the `configure` script. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [gh-89886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89886) and by Victor Stinner in [gh-112090](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112090).)
  * SQLite 3.15.2 or newer is required to build the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") extension module. (Contributed by Erlend Aasland in [gh-105875](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105875).)
  * CPython now bundles the [mimalloc library](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/) by default. It is licensed under the MIT license; see [mimalloc license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html#mimalloc-license). The bundled mimalloc has custom changes, see [gh-113141](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113141) for details. (Contributed by Dino Viehland in [gh-109914](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109914).)
  * The `configure` option [`--with-system-libmpdec`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-system-libmpdec) now defaults to `yes`. The bundled copy of `libmpdecimal` will be removed in Python 3.15.
  * Python built with `configure` [`--with-trace-refs`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-trace-refs) (tracing references) is now ABI compatible with the Python release build and [debug build](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build). (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-108634](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108634).)
  * On POSIX systems, the pkg-config (`.pc`) filenames now include the ABI flags. For example, the free-threaded build generates `python-3.13t.pc` and the debug build generates `python-3.13d.pc`.
  * The `errno`, `fcntl`, `grp`, `md5`, `pwd`, `resource`, `termios`, `winsound`, `_ctypes_test`, `_multiprocessing.posixshmem`, `_scproxy`, `_stat`, `_statistics`, `_testconsole`, `_testimportmultiple` and `_uuid` C extensions are now built with the [limited C API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-c-api). (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-85283](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85283).)

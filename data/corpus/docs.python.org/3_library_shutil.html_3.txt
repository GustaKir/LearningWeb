Title: shutil.copy2: File Copying with Metadata Preservation
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html
Summary: The `shutil.copy2()` function copies a file similar to `copy()`, but it also preserves metadata. When `follow_symlinks` is set to false, it attempts to copy metadata from a symbolic link to a new symbolic link at the destination. This feature may not be available on all platforms, and `copy2()` will preserve as much metadata as possible without raising errors.

shutil.copy2(_src_ , _dst_ , _*_ , _follow_symlinks =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "Link to this definition")
    
Identical to [`copy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy "shutil.copy") except that [`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") also attempts to preserve file metadata.
When _follow_symlinks_ is false, and _src_ is a symbolic link, [`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") attempts to copy all metadata from the _src_ symbolic link to the newly created _dst_ symbolic link. However, this functionality is not available on all platforms. On platforms where some or all of this functionality is unavailable, [`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") will preserve all the metadata it can; [`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") never raises an exception because it cannot preserve file metadata.
[`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") uses [`copystat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copystat "shutil.copystat") to copy the file metadata. Please see [`copystat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copystat "shutil.copystat") for more information about platform support for modifying symbolic link metadata.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `shutil.copyfile` with arguments `src`, `dst`.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `shutil.copystat` with arguments `src`, `dst`.
Changed in version 3.3: Added _follow_symlinks_ argument, try to copy extended file system attributes too (currently Linux only). Now returns path to the newly created file.
Changed in version 3.8: Platform-specific fast-copy syscalls may be used internally in order to copy the file more efficiently. See [Platform-dependent efficient copy operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil-platform-dependent-efficient-copy-operations) section. 

shutil.ignore_patterns(_* patterns_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.ignore_patterns "Link to this definition")
    
This factory function creates a function that can be used as a callable for [`copytree()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree "shutil.copytree")'s _ignore_ argument, ignoring files and directories that match one of the glob-style _patterns_ provided. See the example below.

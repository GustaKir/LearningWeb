Title: Complex Numbers in cmath Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html
Summary: The cmath.nanj function represents a complex number with a zero real part and NaN imaginary part, equivalent to complex(0.0, float('nan')). This feature was added in Python 3.6. The cmath module offers similar functions to the math module, but always returns a complex number, addressing user preferences regarding complex number handling.

cmath.nanj[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html#cmath.nanj "Link to this definition")
    
Complex number with zero real part and NaN imaginary part. Equivalent to `complex(0.0, float('nan'))`.
Added in version 3.6.
Note that the selection of functions is similar, but not identical, to that in module [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math "math: Mathematical functions \(sin\(\) etc.\)."). The reason for having two modules is that some users aren’t interested in complex numbers, and perhaps don’t even know what they are. They would rather have `math.sqrt(-1)` raise an exception than return a complex number. Also note that the functions defined in [`cmath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html#module-cmath "cmath: Mathematical functions for complex numbers.") always return a complex number, even if the answer can be expressed as a real number (in which case the complex number has an imaginary part of zero).
A note on branch cuts: They are curves along which the given function fails to be continuous. They are a necessary feature of many complex functions. It is assumed that if you need to compute with complex functions, you will understand about branch cuts. Consult almost any (not too elementary) book on complex variables for enlightenment. For information of the proper choice of branch cuts for numerical purposes, a good reference should be the following:

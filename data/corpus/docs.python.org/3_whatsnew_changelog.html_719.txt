Title: Python Enhancement Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Several fixes and enhancements have been made in Python, including the removal of an ineffective argument check, improvements in the subprocess module to preserve exceptions, updates to the _strptime module for timezone changes, better error reporting for package initialization failures with the 'python -m' option, and suppression of irrelevant messages during package execution.
---

The check on the number of arguments has been dropped completely as it never worked correctly anyway.
  * [bpo-25764](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25764): In the subprocess module, preserve any exception caused by fork() failure when preexec_fn is used.
  * [bpo-6478](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6478): _strptime’s regexp cache now is reset after changing timezone with time.tzset().
  * [bpo-14285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=14285): When executing a package with the “python -m package” option, and package initialization fails, a proper traceback is now reported. The “runpy” module now lets exceptions from package initialization pass back to the caller, rather than raising ImportError.
  * [bpo-19771](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19771): Also in runpy and the “-m” option, omit the irrelevant message “… is a package and cannot be directly executed” if the package could not even be initialized (e.g. due to a bad `*.pyc` file).
  * [bpo-25177](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25177): Fixed problem with the mean of very small and very large numbers. As a side effect, statistics.mean and statistics.variance should be significantly faster.
  * [bpo-25718](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25718): Fixed copying object with state with boolean value is false.
  * [bpo-10131](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10131): Fixed deep copying of minidom documents. Based on patch by Marian Ganisin.
  * [bpo-25725](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25725): Fixed a reference leak in pickle.loads() when unpickling invalid data including tuple instructions.
  * [bpo-25663](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25663): In the Readline completer, avoid listing duplicate global names, and search the global namespace before searching builtins.
  * [bpo-25688](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25688): Fixed file leak in ElementTree.iterparse() raising an error.
  * [bpo-23914](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23914): Fixed SystemError raised by unpickler on broken pickle data.
  * [bpo-25691](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25691): Fixed crash on deleting ElementTree.Element attributes.
  * [bpo-25624](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25624): ZipFile now always writes a ZIP_STORED header for directory entries. Patch by Dingyuan Wang.
  * Skip getaddrinfo if host is already resolved. Patch by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis.
  * [bpo-26050](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26050): Add asyncio.StreamReader.readuntil() method. Patch by Марк Коренберг.
  * [bpo-25924](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25924): Avoid unnecessary serialization of getaddrinfo(3) calls on OS X versions 10.5 or higher. Original patch by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis.
  * [bpo-26406](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26406): Avoid unnecessary serialization of getaddrinfo(3) calls on current versions of OpenBSD and NetBSD. Patch by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis.
  * [bpo-26848](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26848): Fix asyncio/subprocess.communicate() to handle empty input. Patch by Jack O’Connor.
  * [bpo-27040](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27040): Add loop.get_exception_handler method
  * [bpo-27041](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27041): asyncio: Add loop.create_future method
  * [bpo-27223](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27223): asyncio: Fix _read_ready and _write_ready to respect _conn_lost. Patch by Łukasz Langa.
  * [bpo-22970](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22970): asyncio: Fix inconsistency cancelling Condition.wait. Patch by David Coles.

### Documentation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id281 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-45216](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45216): Remove extra documentation listing methods in `difflib`. It was rendering twice in pydoc and was outdated in some places.
  * [bpo-45024](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45024): [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers") documentation has been expanded to explicitly cover how instance and subclass checks work, with additional doctest examples and an exhaustive list of ABCs which test membership purely by presence of the right [special method](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-special-method)s. Patch by Raymond Hettinger.
  * [bpo-44957](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44957): Promote PEP 604 union syntax by using it where possible. Also, mention `X | Y` more prominently in section about `Union` and mention `X | None` at all in section about `Optional`.
  * [bpo-16580](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16580): Added code equivalents for the [`int.to_bytes()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.to_bytes "int.to_bytes") and [`int.from_bytes()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytes "int.from_bytes") methods, as well as tests ensuring that these code equivalents are valid.
  * [bpo-44903](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44903): Removed the `othergui.rst` file, any references to it, and the list of GUI frameworks in the FAQ. In their place I’ve added links to the Python Wiki [page on GUI frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming).
  * [bpo-33479](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33479): Tkinter documentation has been greatly expanded with new “Architecture” and “Threading model” sections.
  * [bpo-36700](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36700): [`base64`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#module-base64 "base64: RFC 4648: Base16, Base32, Base64 Data Encodings; Base85 and Ascii85") RFC references were updated to point to [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html); a section was added to point users to the new “security considerations” section of the RFC.
  * [bpo-44740](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44740): Replaced occurrences of uppercase “Web” and “Internet” with lowercase versions per the 2016 revised Associated Press Style Book.
  * [bpo-44693](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44693): Update the definition of __future__ in the glossary by replacing the confusing word “pseudo-module” with a more accurate description.
  * [bpo-35183](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35183): Add typical examples to os.path.splitext docs
  * [bpo-30511](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30511): Clarify that [`shutil.make_archive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.make_archive "shutil.make_archive") is not thread-safe due to reliance on changing the current working directory.
  * [bpo-44561](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44561): Update of three expired hyperlinks in Doc/distributing/index.rst: “Project structure”, “Building and packaging the project”, and “Uploading the project to the Python Packaging Index”.
  * [bpo-44651](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44651): Delete entry “coercion” in Doc/glossary.rst for its outdated definition.
  * [bpo-42958](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42958): Updated the docstring and docs of [`filecmp.cmp()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.cmp "filecmp.cmp") to be more accurate and less confusing especially in respect to _shallow_ arg.
  * [bpo-44631](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44631): Refactored the `repr()` code of the `_Environ` (os module).
  * [bpo-44613](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44613): importlib.metadata is no longer provisional.
  * [bpo-44558](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44558): Match the docstring and python implementation of [`countOf()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.countOf "operator.countOf") to the behavior of its c implementation.
  * [bpo-44544](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44544): List all kwargs for [`textwrap.wrap()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.wrap "textwrap.wrap"), [`textwrap.fill()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.fill "textwrap.fill"), and [`textwrap.shorten()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.shorten "textwrap.shorten"). Now, there are nav links to attributes of `TextWrap`, which makes navigation much easier while minimizing duplication in the documentation.

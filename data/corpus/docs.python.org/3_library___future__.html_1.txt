Title: __future__ Module Features
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html
Summary: The `__future__` module in Python allows the introduction of features that are not yet part of the language standard. Since its introduction in Python 2.1, various features such as nested scopes, generators, and changes to the division operator have been incorporated into Python as mandatory or optional features along with their corresponding PEPs.

## Module Contents[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-contents "Link to this heading")
No feature description will ever be deleted from [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions"). Since its introduction in Python 2.1 the following features have found their way into the language using this mechanism:
feature | optional in | mandatory in | effect  
---|---|---|---  
nested_scopes | 2.1.0b1 | 2.2 | [**PEP 227**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0227/): _Statically Nested Scopes_  
generators | 2.2.0a1 | 2.3 | [**PEP 255**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0255/): _Simple Generators_  
division | 2.2.0a2 | 3.0 | [**PEP 238**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0238/): _Changing the Division Operator_  
absolute_import | 2.5.0a1 | 3.0 | [**PEP 328**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0328/): _Imports: Multi-Line and Absolute/Relative_  
with_statement | 2.5.0a1 | 2.6 | [**PEP 343**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/): _The “with” Statement_  
print_function | 2.6.0a2 | 3.0 | [**PEP 3105**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3105/): _Make print a function_  
unicode_literals | 2.6.0a2 | 3.0 | [**PEP 3112**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3112/): _Bytes literals in Python 3000_  
generator_stop | 3.5.0b1 | 3.7 | [**PEP 479**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0479/): _StopIteration handling inside generators_  
annotations | 3.7.0b1 | TBD [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#id2) | [**PEP 563**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/): _Postponed evaluation of annotations_ 

_class_ __future__._Feature[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#future__._Feature "Link to this definition")
      
Each statement in `__future__.py` is of the form:
```
FeatureName = _Feature(OptionalRelease, MandatoryRelease,
            CompilerFlag)

```

where, normally, _OptionalRelease_ is less than _MandatoryRelease_ , and both are 5-tuples of the same form as [`sys.version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info "sys.version_info"):
```
(PY_MAJOR_VERSION, # the 2 in 2.1.0a3; an int
 PY_MINOR_VERSION, # the 1; an int
 PY_MICRO_VERSION, # the 0; an int
 PY_RELEASE_LEVEL, # "alpha", "beta", "candidate" or "final"; string
 PY_RELEASE_SERIAL # the 3; an int
)

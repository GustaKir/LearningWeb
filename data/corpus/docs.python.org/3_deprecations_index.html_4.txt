Title: Deprecations in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/deprecations/index.html
Summary: Accessing `co_lnotab` was deprecated in PEP 626 since Python 3.10, with plans for removal in 3.12 and a warning introduced in 3.12. It may be removed in 3.15. Additionally, the undocumented keyword argument syntax for `NamedTuple` creation has been deprecated since Python 3.13, recommending the use of class-based or functional syntax instead.

"): Accessing [`co_lnotab`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lnotab "codeobject.co_lnotab") was deprecated in [**PEP 626**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0626/) since 3.10 and was planned to be removed in 3.12, but it only got a proper [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") in 3.12. May be removed in 3.15. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-101866](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101866).)
  * [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\)."):
    * The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating [`NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple "typing.NamedTuple") classes (e.g. `Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)`) has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.
    * The [`typing.no_type_check_decorator()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.no_type_check_decorator "typing.no_type_check_decorator") decorator function has been deprecated since Python 3.13. After eight years in the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\).") module, it has yet to be supported by any major type checker.
  * [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."):
    * The [`getmark()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmark "wave.Wave_read.getmark"), `setmark()`, and [`getmarkers()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmarkers "wave.Wave_read.getmarkers") methods of the [`Wave_read`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read "wave.Wave_read") and [`Wave_write`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write "wave.Wave_write") classes have been deprecated since Python 3.13.

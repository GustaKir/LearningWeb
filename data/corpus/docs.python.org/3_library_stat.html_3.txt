Title: File Type and Permission Flags in Python's stat Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html
Summary: This section discusses three specific file type constants in the Python stat module: `S_IFWHT` for whiteout, and permission-related flags `S_ISUID` and `S_ISGID`. It notes that certain constants may be defined as 0 on platforms lacking support for those file types and mentions their relevance in the `os.chmod()` function.

stat.S_IFWHT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFWHT "Link to this definition")
    
Whiteout.
Added in version 3.4.
Note
[`S_IFDOOR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFDOOR "stat.S_IFDOOR"), [`S_IFPORT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFPORT "stat.S_IFPORT") or [`S_IFWHT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IFWHT "stat.S_IFWHT") are defined as 0 when the platform does not have support for the file types.
The following flags can also be used in the _mode_ argument of [`os.chmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod "os.chmod"): 

stat.S_ISUID[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ISUID "Link to this definition")
    
Set UID bit. 

stat.S_ISGID[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ISGID "Link to this definition")
    
Set-group-ID bit. This bit has several special uses. For a directory it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory: files created there inherit their group ID from the directory, not from the effective group ID of the creating process, and directories created there will also get the [`S_ISGID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ISGID "stat.S_ISGID") bit set. For a file that does not have the group execution bit ([`S_IXGRP`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXGRP "stat.S_IXGRP")) set, the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking (see also [`S_ENFMT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ENFMT "stat.S_ENFMT")). 

stat.S_ISVTX[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ISVTX "Link to this definition")
    
Sticky bit. When this bit is set on a directory it means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file, by the owner of the directory, or by a privileged process. 

stat.S_IRWXU[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRWXU "Link to this definition")
    
Mask for file owner permissions. 

stat.S_IRUSR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRUSR "Link to this definition")
    
Owner has read permission. 

stat.S_IWUSR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IWUSR "Link to this definition")
    
Owner has write permission. 

stat.S_IXUSR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXUSR "Link to this definition")
    
Owner has execute permission. 

stat.S_IRWXG[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRWXG "Link to this definition")
    
Mask for group permissions. 

stat.S_IRGRP[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRGRP "Link to this definition")
    
Group has read permission. 

stat.S_IWGRP[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IWGRP "Link to this definition")
    
Group has write permission. 

stat.S_IXGRP[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXGRP "Link to this definition")
    
Group has execute permission. 

stat.S_IRWXO[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRWXO "Link to this definition")
    
Mask for permissions for others (not in group). 

stat.S_IROTH[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IROTH "Link to this definition")
    
Others have read permission. 

stat.S_IWOTH[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IWOTH "Link to this definition")
    
Others have write permission. 

stat.S_IXOTH[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXOTH "Link to this definition")
    
Others have execute permission. 

stat.S_ENFMT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ENFMT "Link to this definition")
    
System V file locking enforcement. This flag is shared with [`S_ISGID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_ISGID "stat.S_ISGID"): file/record locking is enforced on files that do not have the group execution bit ([`S_IXGRP`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXGRP "stat.S_IXGRP")) set. 

stat.S_IREAD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IREAD "Link to this definition")
    
Unix V7 synonym for [`S_IRUSR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IRUSR "stat.S_IRUSR"). 

stat.S_IWRITE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IWRITE "Link to this definition")
    
Unix V7 synonym for [`S_IWUSR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IWUSR "stat.S_IWUSR"). 

stat.S_IEXEC[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IEXEC "Link to this definition")
    
Unix V7 synonym for [`S_IXUSR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.S_IXUSR "stat.S_IXUSR").
The following flags can be used in the _flags_ argument of [`os.chflags()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chflags "os.chflags"): 

stat.UF_SETTABLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#stat.UF_SETTABLE "Link to this definition")
    
All user settable flags.
Added in version 3.13.

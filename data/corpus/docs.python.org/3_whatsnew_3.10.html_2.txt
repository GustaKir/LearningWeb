## New Features[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#new-features "Link to this heading")
### Parenthesized context managers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#parenthesized-context-managers "Link to this heading")
Using enclosing parentheses for continuation across multiple lines in context managers is now supported. This allows formatting a long collection of context managers in multiple lines in a similar way as it was previously possible with import statements. For instance, all these examples are now valid:
```
with (CtxManager() as example):
  ...
with (
  CtxManager1(),
  CtxManager2()
):
  ...
with (CtxManager1() as example,
   CtxManager2()):
  ...
with (CtxManager1(),
   CtxManager2() as example):
  ...
with (
  CtxManager1() as example1,
  CtxManager2() as example2
):
  ...

```

it is also possible to use a trailing comma at the end of the enclosed group:
```
with (
  CtxManager1() as example1,
  CtxManager2() as example2,
  CtxManager3() as example3,
):
  ...

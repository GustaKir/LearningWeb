### Core and Builtins[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#core-and-builtins "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-132713](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132713): Fix `repr(list)` race condition: hold a strong reference to the item while calling `repr(item)`. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-132747](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132747): Fix a crash when calling [`__get__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__get__ "object.__get__") of a [method](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method) with a [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") second argument.
  * [gh-124476](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124476): Fix decoding from the locale encoding in the C.UTF-8 locale.
  * [gh-131927](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131927): Compiler warnings originating from the same module and line number are now only emitted once, matching the behaviour of warnings emitted from user code. This can also be configured with [`warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#module-warnings "warnings: Issue warning messages and control their disposition.") filters.
  * [gh-130070](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130070): Fixed an assertion error for [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") passed a string `source` and a non-`None` `closure`. Patch by Bartosz Sławecki.
  * [gh-129958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129958): Fix a bug that was allowing newlines inconsitently in format specifiers for single-quoted f-strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#c-api "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-132909](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132909): Fix an overflow when handling the [K](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#capi-py-buildvalue-format-k) format in [`Py_BuildValue()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#c.Py_BuildValue "Py_BuildValue"). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.


### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#build "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-132649](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132649): The `PClayout` script now allows passing `--include-tcltk` on Windows ARM64.


## Python 3.13.3 final[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-3-final "Link to this heading")

### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#macos "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124111](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124111): Update macOS installer to use Tcl/Tk 8.6.16.
  * [gh-131423](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131423): Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 3.0.16. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  * [gh-131025](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131025): Update macOS installer to ship with SQLite 3.49.1.
  * [gh-91132](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91132): Update macOS installer to use ncurses 6.5.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#windows "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-131423](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131423): Update bundled version of OpenSSL to 3.0.16. The new build also disables uplink support, which may be relevant to embedders but has no impact on normal use.
  * [gh-131025](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131025): Update Windows installer to ship with SQLite 3.49.1.
  * [gh-131020](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131020): [pylauncher](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/PC/launcher2.c) correctly detects a BOM when searching for the shebang. Fix by Chris Eibl.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#tools-demos "Link to this heading")

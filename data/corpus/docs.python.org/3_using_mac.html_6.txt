Title: Distributing Python Applications on macOS
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html
Summary: This section details tools for creating standalone distributable applications from Python code on macOS. It includes options like py2app for creating `.app` bundles, Briefcase for cross-platform packaging and managing app signing, and PyInstaller for creating distributable artifacts.

Note
Current `python.org` installers only install to fixed locations like `/Library/Frameworks/`, `/Applications`, and `/usr/local/bin`. You cannot use the **installer** `-domain` option to install to other locations.
### 5.5.3. Distributing Python Applications[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#distributing-python-applications "Link to this heading")
A range of tools exist for converting your Python code into a standalone distributable application:
  * [py2app](https://pypi.org/project/py2app/): Supports creating macOS `.app` bundles from a Python project.
  * [Briefcase](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io): Part of the [BeeWare Project](https://beeware.org); a cross-platform packaging tool that supports creation of `.app` bundles on macOS, as well as managing signing and notarization.
  * [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/): A cross-platform packaging tool that creates a single file or folder as a distributable artifact.


### 5.5.4. App Store Compliance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#app-store-compliance "Link to this heading")
Apps submitted for distribution through the macOS App Store must pass Apple’s app review process. This process includes a set of automated validation rules that inspect the submitted application bundle for problematic code.
The Python standard library contains some code that is known to violate these automated rules. While these violations appear to be false positives, Apple’s review rules cannot be challenged. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the Python standard library for an app to pass App Store review.
The Python source tree contains [a patch file](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Mac/Resources/app-store-compliance.patch) that will remove all code that is known to cause issues with the App Store review process. This patch is applied automatically when CPython is configured with the [`--with-app-store-compliance`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-app-store-compliance) option.
This patch is not normally required to use CPython on a Mac; nor is it required if you are distributing an app _outside_ the macOS App Store. It is _only_ required if you are using the macOS App Store as a distribution channel.
## 5.6. Other Resources[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#other-resources "Link to this heading")
The [python.org Help page](https://www.python.org/about/help/) has links to many useful resources. The [Pythonmac-SIG mailing list](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/pythonmac-sig/) is another support resource specifically for Python users and developers on the Mac.

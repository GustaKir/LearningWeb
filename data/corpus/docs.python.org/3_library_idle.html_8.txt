The following options are available: 

-c <command>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-c "Link to this definition")
    
Run the specified Python command in the shell window. For example, pass `-c "print('Hello, World!')"`. On Windows, the outer quotes must be double quotes as shown. 

-d[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-d "Link to this definition")
    
Enable the debugger and open the shell window. 

-e[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-e "Link to this definition")
    
Open an editor window. 

-h[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-h "Link to this definition")
    
Print a help message with legal combinations of options and exit. 

-i[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-i "Link to this definition")
    
Open a shell window. 

-r <file>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-r "Link to this definition")
    
Run the specified file in the shell window. 

-s[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-s "Link to this definition")
    
Run the startup file (as defined by the environment variables `IDLESTARTUP` or [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP)) before opening the shell window. 

-t <title>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-t "Link to this definition")
    
Set the title of the shell window. 

-[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#cmdoption-idle-0 "Link to this definition")
    
Read and execute standard input in the shell window. This option must be the last one before any arguments.
If arguments are provided:
  * If `-`, `-c`, or `-r` is used, all arguments are placed in `sys.argv[1:]`, and `sys.argv[0]` is set to `''`, `'-c'`, or `'-r'` respectively. No editor window is opened, even if that is the default set in the _Options_ dialog.
  * Otherwise, arguments are treated as files to be opened for editing, and `sys.argv` reflects the arguments passed to IDLE itself.

Title: Traceback Module: format_frame_summary and FrameSummary Objects
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html
Summary: The `format_frame_summary` method returns a string for printing a specific frame in the stack, called for each `FrameSummary` object. If it returns `None`, the frame is excluded from the output. Additionally, `FrameSummary` objects were introduced in version 3.5 to represent individual frames in a traceback.

format_frame_summary(_frame_summary_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a string for printing one of the [frames](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) involved in the stack. This method is called for each [`FrameSummary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary "traceback.FrameSummary") object to be printed by [`StackSummary.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.format "traceback.StackSummary.format"). If it returns `None`, the frame is omitted from the output.
Added in version 3.11.
## `FrameSummary` Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#framesummary-objects "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.5.
A `FrameSummary` object represents a single [frame](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) in a [traceback](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects). 

_class_ traceback.FrameSummary(_filename_ , _lineno_ , _name_ , _*_ , _lookup_line =True_, _locals =None_, _line =None_, _end_lineno =None_, _colno =None_, _end_colno =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary "Link to this definition")
    
Represents a single [frame](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) in the [traceback](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects) or stack that is being formatted or printed. It may optionally have a stringified version of the frame’s locals included in it. If _lookup_line_ is `False`, the source code is not looked up until the `FrameSummary` has the [`line`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.line "traceback.FrameSummary.line") attribute accessed (which also happens when casting it to a [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")). [`line`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.line "traceback.FrameSummary.line") may be directly provided, and will prevent line lookups happening at all. _locals_ is an optional local variable mapping, and if supplied the variable representations are stored in the summary for later display.
`FrameSummary` instances have the following attributes: 

filename[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.filename "Link to this definition")
    
The filename of the source code for this frame. Equivalent to accessing [`f.f_code.co_filename`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_filename "codeobject.co_filename") on a [frame object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) _f_. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number of the source code for this frame. 

name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.name "Link to this definition")
    
Equivalent to accessing [`f.f_code.co_name`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_name "codeobject.co_name") on a [frame object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) _f_. 

line[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.line "Link to this definition")
    
A string representing the source code for this frame, with leading and trailing whitespace stripped. If the source is not available, it is `None`. 

end_lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.end_lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The last line number of the source code for this frame. By default, it is set to `lineno` and indexation starts from 1.
Changed in version 3.13: The default value changed from `None` to `lineno`. 

colno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.colno "Link to this definition")
    
The column number of the source code for this frame. By default, it is `None` and indexation starts from 0. 

end_colno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary.end_colno "Link to this definition")
    
The last column number of the source code for this frame. By default, it is `None` and indexation starts from 0.
## Examples of Using the Module-Level Functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#examples-of-using-the-module-level-functions "Link to this heading")
This simple example implements a basic read-eval-print loop, similar to (but less useful than) the standard Python interactive interpreter loop. For a more complete implementation of the interpreter loop, refer to the [`code`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html#module-code "code: Facilities to implement read-eval-print loops.") module.

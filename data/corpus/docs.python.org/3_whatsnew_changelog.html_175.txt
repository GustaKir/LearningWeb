Aasland.
  * [gh-103848](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103848): Add checks to ensure that `[` bracketed `]` hosts found by [`urllib.parse.urlsplit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit "urllib.parse.urlsplit") are of IPv6 or IPvFuture format.
  * [gh-103872](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103872): Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.1.2.
  * [gh-99944](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99944): Make [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis "dis: Disassembler for Python bytecode.") display the value of oparg of `KW_NAMES`.
  * [gh-74940](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74940): The C.UTF-8 locale is no longer converted to en_US.UTF-8, enabling the use of UTF-8 encoding on systems which have no locales installed.
  * [gh-103861](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103861): Fix `zipfile.Zipfile` creating invalid zip files when `force_zip64` was used to add files to them. Patch by Carey Metcalfe.
  * [gh-103857](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103857): Deprecated [`datetime.datetime.utcnow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcnow "datetime.datetime.utcnow") and [`datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp"). (Patch by Paul Ganssle)
  * [gh-103839](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103839): Avoid compilation error due to tommath.h not being found when building Tkinter against Tcl 8.7 built with bundled libtommath.
  * [gh-103791](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103791): [`contextlib.suppress`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress "contextlib.suppress") now supports suppressing exceptions raised as part of an [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup"). If other exceptions exist on the group, they are re-raised in a group that does not contain the suppressed exceptions.
  * [gh-90750](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90750): Use [`datetime.datetime.fromisocalendar()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisocalendar "datetime.datetime.fromisocalendar") in the implementation of [`datetime.datetime.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime "datetime.datetime.strptime"), which should now accept only valid ISO dates. (Patch by Paul Ganssle)
  * [gh-103685](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103685): Prepare `tkinter.Menu.index()` for Tk 8.7 so that it does not raise `TclError: expected integer but got ""` when it should return `None`.
  * [gh-81403](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81403): [`urllib.request.CacheFTPHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.CacheFTPHandler "urllib.request.CacheFTPHandler") no longer raises `URLError` if a cached FTP instance is reused. ftplibâ€™s endtransfer method calls voidresp to drain the connection to handle FTP instance reuse properly.
  * [gh-103699](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103699): Add `__orig_bases__` to non-generic TypedDicts, call-based TypedDicts, and call-based NamedTuples. Other TypedDicts and NamedTuples already had the attribute.
  * [gh-103693](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103693): Add convenience variable feature to [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  * [gh-92248](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92248): Deprecate `type`, `choices`, and `metavar` parameters of `argparse.BooleanOptionalAction`.
  * [gh-89415](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89415): Add [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") constants for source-specific multicast. Patch by Reese Hyde.
  * [gh-103673](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103673): [`socketserver`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#module-socketserver "socketserver: A framework for network servers.") gains `ForkingUnixStreamServer` and `ForkingUnixDatagramServer` classes. Patch by Jay Berry.
  * [gh-103636](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103636): Added Enum for months and days in the calendar module.
  * [gh-84976](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84976): Create a new `Lib/_pydatetime.py` file that defines the Python version of the `datetime` module, and make `datetime` import the contents of the new library only if the C implementation is missing.

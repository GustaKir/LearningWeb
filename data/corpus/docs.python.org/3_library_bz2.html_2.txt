Title: bz2.BZ2File Methods Documentation
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html
Summary: This section details various methods of the bz2.BZ2File class including seekable(), writable(), read1(), and readinto(), which provide functionality for file seeking, writing status, and reading bytes from BZ2-compressed files. All methods were added in Python version 3.3.
---

seekable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.seekable "Link to this definition")
    
Return whether the file supports seeking.
Added in version 3.3. 

writable()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.writable "Link to this definition")
    
Return whether the file was opened for writing.
Added in version 3.3. 

read1(_size =-1_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.read1 "Link to this definition")
    
Read up to _size_ uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a buffer’s worth of data if size is negative.
Returns `b''` if the file is at EOF.
Added in version 3.3. 

readinto(_b_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.readinto "Link to this definition")
    
Read bytes into _b_.
Returns the number of bytes read (0 for EOF).
Added in version 3.3. 

mode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.mode "Link to this definition")
    
`'rb'` for reading and `'wb'` for writing.
Added in version 3.13. 

name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File.name "Link to this definition")
    
The bzip2 file name. Equivalent to the [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.FileIO.name "io.FileIO.name") attribute of the underlying [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object).
Added in version 3.13.
Changed in version 3.1: Support for the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement was added.
Changed in version 3.3: Support was added for _filename_ being a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) instead of an actual filename.
The `'a'` (append) mode was added, along with support for reading multi-stream files.
Changed in version 3.4: The `'x'` (exclusive creation) mode was added.
Changed in version 3.5: The [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.read "io.BufferedIOBase.read") method now accepts an argument of `None`.
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).
Changed in version 3.9: The _buffering_ parameter has been removed. It was ignored and deprecated since Python 3.0. Pass an open file object to control how the file is opened.
The _compresslevel_ parameter became keyword-only.
Changed in version 3.10: This class is thread unsafe in the face of multiple simultaneous readers or writers, just like its equivalent classes in [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") and [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library.") have always been.
## Incremental (de)compression[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#incremental-de-compression "Link to this heading") 

_class_ bz2.BZ2Compressor(_compresslevel =9_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Compressor "Link to this definition")
    
Create a new compressor object. This object may be used to compress data incrementally. For one-shot compression, use the [`compress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.compress "bz2.compress") function instead.
_compresslevel_ , if given, must be an integer between `1` and `9`. The default is `9`. 

compress(_data_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Compressor.compress "Link to this definition")
    
Provide data to the compressor object. Returns a chunk of compressed data if possible, or an empty byte string otherwise.
When you have finished providing data to the compressor, call the [`flush()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Compressor.flush "bz2.BZ2Compressor.flush") method to finish the compression process. 

flush()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Compressor.flush "Link to this definition")
    
Finish the compression process. Returns the compressed data left in internal buffers.
The compressor object may not be used after this method has been called.

# `select` — Waiting for I/O completion[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#module-select "Link to this heading")
This module provides access to the `select()` and `poll()` functions available in most operating systems, `devpoll()` available on Solaris and derivatives, `epoll()` available on Linux 2.5+ and `kqueue()` available on most BSD. Note that on Windows, it only works for sockets; on other operating systems, it also works for other file types (in particular, on Unix, it works on pipes). It cannot be used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since it was last read.
Note
The [`selectors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#module-selectors "selectors: High-level I/O multiplexing.") module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built upon the [`select`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#module-select "select: Wait for I/O completion on multiple streams.") module primitives. Users are encouraged to use the [`selectors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#module-selectors "selectors: High-level I/O multiplexing.") module instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level primitives used.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): not WASI.
This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See [WebAssembly platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#wasm-availability) for more information.
The module defines the following: 

_exception_ select.error[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.error "Link to this definition")
    
A deprecated alias of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").
Changed in version 3.3: Following [**PEP 3151**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3151/), this class was made an alias of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").

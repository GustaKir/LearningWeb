Title: File Comparison in Python - filecmp Module Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html
Summary: This section covers the `filecmp.clear_cache()` function which clears the file comparison cache, useful for immediate comparisons after file modifications. It also introduces the `dircmp` class, allowing comparison of two directories, with options to ignore and hide certain file names.
---

filecmp.clear_cache()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.clear_cache "Link to this definition")
    
Clear the filecmp cache. This may be useful if a file is compared so quickly after it is modified that it is within the mtime resolution of the underlying filesystem.
Added in version 3.4.
## The [`dircmp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp "filecmp.dircmp") class[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#the-dircmp-class "Link to this heading") 

_class_ filecmp.dircmp(_a_ , _b_ , _ignore =None_, _hide =None_, _*_ , _shallow =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp "Link to this definition")
    
Construct a new directory comparison object, to compare the directories _a_ and _b_. _ignore_ is a list of names to ignore, and defaults to [`filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES "filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES"). _hide_ is a list of names to hide, and defaults to `[os.curdir, os.pardir]`.
The [`dircmp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp "filecmp.dircmp") class compares files by doing _shallow_ comparisons as described for [`filecmp.cmp()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.cmp "filecmp.cmp") by default using the _shallow_ parameter.
Changed in version 3.13: Added the _shallow_ parameter.
The [`dircmp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp "filecmp.dircmp") class provides the following methods: 

report()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.report "Link to this definition")
    
Print (to [`sys.stdout`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout "sys.stdout")) a comparison between _a_ and _b_. 

report_partial_closure()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.report_partial_closure "Link to this definition")
    
Print a comparison between _a_ and _b_ and common immediate subdirectories. 

report_full_closure()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.report_full_closure "Link to this definition")
    
Print a comparison between _a_ and _b_ and common subdirectories (recursively).
The [`dircmp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp "filecmp.dircmp") class offers a number of interesting attributes that may be used to get various bits of information about the directory trees being compared.
Note that via [`__getattr__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__ "object.__getattr__") hooks, all attributes are computed lazily, so there is no speed penalty if only those attributes which are lightweight to compute are used. 

left[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.left "Link to this definition")
    
The directory _a_. 

right[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.right "Link to this definition")
    
The directory _b_. 

left_list[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.left_list "Link to this definition")
    
Files and subdirectories in _a_ , filtered by _hide_ and _ignore_. 

right_list[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.right_list "Link to this definition")
    
Files and subdirectories in _b_ , filtered by _hide_ and _ignore_. 

common[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.common "Link to this definition")
    
Files and subdirectories in both _a_ and _b_. 

left_only[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.left_only "Link to this definition")
    
Files and subdirectories only in _a_. 

right_only[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.right_only "Link to this definition")
    
Files and subdirectories only in _b_. 

common_dirs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.common_dirs "Link to this definition")
    
Subdirectories in both _a_ and _b_. 

common_files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.common_files "Link to this definition")
    
Files in both _a_ and _b_. 

common_funny[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.common_funny "Link to this definition")
    
Names in both _a_ and _b_ , such that the type differs between the directories, or names for which [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") reports an error. 

same_files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.same_files "Link to this definition")
    
Files which are identical in both _a_ and _b_ , using the class’s file comparison operator. 

diff_files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp.diff_files "Link to this definition")
    
Files which are in both _a_ and _b_ , whose contents differ according to the class’s file comparison operator.

# `resource` — Resource usage information[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#module-resource "Link to this heading")
This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling system resources utilized by a program.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, not WASI.
Symbolic constants are used to specify particular system resources and to request usage information about either the current process or its children.
An [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") is raised on syscall failure. 

_exception_ resource.error[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.error "Link to this definition")
    
A deprecated alias of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").
Changed in version 3.3: Following [**PEP 3151**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3151/), this class was made an alias of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").
## Resource Limits[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource-limits "Link to this heading")
Resources usage can be limited using the [`setrlimit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.setrlimit "resource.setrlimit") function described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the super-user can raise a hard limit.)
The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They are described in the _[getrlimit(2)](https://manpages.debian.org/getrlimit\(2\))_ man page. The resources listed below are supported when the underlying operating system supports them; resources which cannot be checked or controlled by the operating system are not defined in this module for those platforms. 

resource.RLIM_INFINITY[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIM_INFINITY "Link to this definition")
    
Constant used to represent the limit for an unlimited resource.

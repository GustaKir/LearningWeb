Title: Improvements in IDLE
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section details several enhancements made to IDLE, including DPI scaling for sharper text on high-resolution displays, the ability to move context lines to the top of the editor window when clicked, the implementation of a read-only text widget for code context, and scroll adjustments to move editor text by lines instead of pixels.

### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id577 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-33656](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33656): On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales for DPI. On Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python binary unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this should make text and lines sharper. It should otherwise have no effect.
  * [bpo-33768](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33768): Clicking on a context line moves that line to the top of the editor window.
  * [bpo-33763](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33763): IDLE: Use read-only text widget for code context instead of label widget.
  * [bpo-33664](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33664): Scroll IDLE editor text by lines. Previously, the mouse wheel and scrollbar slider moved text by a fixed number of pixels, resulting in partial lines at the top of the editor box. The change also applies to the shell and grep output windows, but not to read-only text views.
  * [bpo-33679](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33679): Enable theme-specific color configuration for Code Context. Use the Highlights tab to see the setting for built-in themes or add settings to custom themes.
  * [bpo-33642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33642): Display up to maxlines non-blank lines for Code Context. If there is no current context, show a single blank line.
  * [bpo-33628](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33628): IDLE: Cleanup codecontext.py and its test.
  * [bpo-33564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33564): IDLE’s code context now recognizes async as a block opener.
  * [bpo-29706](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29706): IDLE now colors async and await as keywords in 3.6. They become full keywords in 3.7.
  * [bpo-21474](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21474): Update word/identifier definition from ascii to unicode. In text and entry boxes, this affects selection by double-click, movement left/right by control-left/right, and deletion left/right by control-BACKSPACE/DEL.
  * [bpo-33204](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33204): IDLE: consistently color invalid string prefixes. A ‘u’ string prefix cannot be paired with either ‘r’ or ‘f’. Consistently color as much of the prefix, starting at the right, as is valid. Revise and extend colorizer test.
  * [bpo-32831](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32831): Add docstrings and tests for codecontext.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id578 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-33189](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33189): **pygettext.py** now recognizes only literal strings as docstrings and translatable strings, and rejects bytes literals and f-string expressions.
  * [bpo-31920](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31920): Fixed handling directories as arguments in the `pygettext` script. Based on patch by Oleg Krasnikov.
  * [bpo-29673](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29673): Fix pystackv and pystack gdbinit macros.
  * [bpo-32885](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32885): Add an `-n` flag for `Tools/scripts/pathfix.py` to disable automatic backup creation (files with `~` suffix).
  * [bpo-31583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31583): Fix 2to3 for using with –add-suffix option but without –output-dir option for relative path to files in current directory.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id579 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-32374](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32374): Document that m_traverse for multi-phase initialized modules can be called with m_state=NULL, and add a sanity check

Title: tarfile — Read and write tar archive files
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html
Summary: The `tarfile` module allows for reading and writing tar archives, supporting gzip, bz2, and lzma compression. It is distinct from the `zipfile` module, which is used for `.zip` files, and offers higher-level functions through the `shutil` module for archiving operations.

# `tarfile` — Read and write tar archive files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/tarfile.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/tarfile.py)
The [`tarfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files.") module makes it possible to read and write tar archives, including those using gzip, bz2 and lzma compression. Use the [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") module to read or write `.zip` files, or the higher-level functions in [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#archiving-operations).
Some facts and figures:
  * reads and writes [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects."), [`bz2`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#module-bz2 "bz2: Interfaces for bzip2 compression and decompression.") and [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library.") compressed archives if the respective modules are available.
  * read/write support for the POSIX.1-1988 (ustar) format.
  * read/write support for the GNU tar format including _longname_ and _longlink_ extensions, read-only support for all variants of the _sparse_ extension including restoration of sparse files.
  * read/write support for the POSIX.1-2001 (pax) format.
  * handles directories, regular files, hardlinks, symbolic links, fifos, character devices and block devices and is able to acquire and restore file information like timestamp, access permissions and owner.


Changed in version 3.3: Added support for [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library.") compression.
Changed in version 3.12: Archives are extracted using a [filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter), which makes it possible to either limit surprising/dangerous features, or to acknowledge that they are expected and the archive is fully trusted. By default, archives are fully trusted, but this default is deprecated and slated to change in Python 3.14.

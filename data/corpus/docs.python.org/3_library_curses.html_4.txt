Title: curses Color Initialization Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html
Summary: This section describes two functions in the curses library: `init_color()` and `init_pair()`. `init_color()` allows users to change the RGB definition of a specified color number, affecting all instances of that color on the screen. The function requires parameters within specific ranges and is functional only if `can_change_color()` returns `True`. `init_pair()` is also introduced, indicating further configuration for color pairs.

curses.init_color(_color_number_ , _r_ , _g_ , _b_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.init_color "Link to this definition")
    
Change the definition of a color, taking the number of the color to be changed followed by three RGB values (for the amounts of red, green, and blue components). The value of _color_number_ must be between `0` and `COLORS - 1`. Each of _r_ , _g_ , _b_ , must be a value between `0` and `1000`. When [`init_color()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.init_color "curses.init_color") is used, all occurrences of that color on the screen immediately change to the new definition. This function is a no-op on most terminals; it is active only if [`can_change_color()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.can_change_color "curses.can_change_color") returns `True`. 

curses.init_pair(_pair_number_ , _fg_ , _bg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.init_pair "Link to this definition")
    
Change the definition of a color-pair. It takes three arguments: the number of the color-pair to be changed, the foreground color number, and the background color number. The value of _pair_number_ must be between `1` and `COLOR_PAIRS - 1` (the `0` color pair is wired to white on black and cannot be changed). The value of _fg_ and _bg_ arguments must be between `0` and `COLORS - 1`, or, after calling [`use_default_colors()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.use_default_colors "curses.use_default_colors"), `-1`. If the color-pair was previously initialized, the screen is refreshed and all occurrences of that color-pair are changed to the new definition. 

curses.initscr()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.initscr "Link to this definition")
    
Initialize the library. Return a [window](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses-window-objects) object which represents the whole screen.
Note
If there is an error opening the terminal, the underlying curses library may cause the interpreter to exit. 

curses.is_term_resized(_nlines_ , _ncols_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.is_term_resized "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if [`resize_term()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resize_term "curses.resize_term") would modify the window structure, `False` otherwise. 

curses.isendwin()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.isendwin "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if [`endwin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.endwin "curses.endwin") has been called (that is, the curses library has been deinitialized). 

curses.keyname(_k_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.keyname "Link to this definition")
    
Return the name of the key numbered _k_ as a bytes object. The name of a key generating printable ASCII character is the key’s character. The name of a control-key combination is a two-byte bytes object consisting of a caret (`b'^'`) followed by the corresponding printable ASCII character. The name of an alt-key combination (128–255) is a bytes object consisting of the prefix `b'M-'` followed by the name of the corresponding ASCII character. 

curses.killchar()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.killchar "Link to this definition")
    
Return the user’s current line kill character as a one-byte bytes object. Under Unix operating systems this is a property of the controlling tty of the curses program, and is not set by the curses library itself. 

curses.longname()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.longname "Link to this definition")
    
Return a bytes object containing the terminfo long name field describing the current terminal. The maximum length of a verbose description is 128 characters. It is defined only after the call to [`initscr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.initscr "curses.initscr"). 

curses.meta(_flag_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.meta "Link to this definition")
    
If _flag_ is `True`, allow 8-bit characters to be input. If _flag_ is `False`, allow only 7-bit chars. 

curses.mouseinterval(_interval_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.mouseinterval "Link to this definition")
    
Set the maximum time in milliseconds that can elapse between press and release events in order for them to be recognized as a click, and return the previous interval value. The default value is 200 milliseconds, or one fifth of a second.

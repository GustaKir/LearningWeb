Title: Python 3 Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document outlines several patch contributions, including the acceptance of path-like objects in `pathlib.Path.glob()` and `rglob()`, improvements to `asyncio.Condition.notify()` to prevent lost notifications, and a fix for the `tag_unbind()` methods in `tkinter.Text` and `tkinter.Canvas` classes.

Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
  * [gh-79634](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79634): Accept [path-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) as patterns in [`pathlib.Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") and [`rglob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob "pathlib.Path.rglob").
  * [gh-112202](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112202): Ensure that a [`asyncio.Condition.notify()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Condition.notify "asyncio.Condition.notify") call does not get lost if the awakened `Task` is simultaneously cancelled or encounters any other error.
  * [gh-113951](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113951): Fix the behavior of `tag_unbind()` methods of `tkinter.Text` and `tkinter.Canvas` classes with three arguments. Previously, `widget.tag_unbind(tag, sequence, funcid)` destroyed the current binding for _sequence_ , leaving _sequence_ unbound, and deleted the _funcid_ command. Now it removes only _funcid_ from the binding for _sequence_ , keeping other commands, and deletes the _funcid_ command. It leaves _sequence_ unbound only if _funcid_ was the last bound command.
  * [gh-97959](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97959): Fix rendering class methods, bound methods, method and function aliases in [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system."). Class methods no longer have “method of builtins.type instance” note. Corresponding notes are now added for class and unbound methods. Method and function aliases now have references to the module or the class where the origin was defined if it differs from the current. Bound methods are now listed in the static methods section. Methods of builtin classes are now supported as well as methods of Python classes.
  * [gh-113796](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113796): Add more validation checks in the [`csv.Dialect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Dialect "csv.Dialect") constructor. [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is now raised if the same character is used in different roles.
  * [gh-113732](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113732): Fix support of [`QUOTE_NOTNULL`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.QUOTE_NOTNULL "csv.QUOTE_NOTNULL") and [`QUOTE_STRINGS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.QUOTE_STRINGS "csv.QUOTE_STRINGS") in [`csv.reader()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader "csv.reader").
  * [gh-113225](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113225): Speed up [`pathlib.Path.walk()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.walk "pathlib.Path.walk") by using [`os.DirEntry.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.DirEntry.path "os.DirEntry.path") where possible.
  * [gh-89039](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89039): When replace() method is called on a subclass of datetime, date or time, properly call derived constructor. Previously, only the base class’s constructor was called.
Also, make sure to pass non-zero fold values when creating subclasses in various methods. Previously, fold was silently ignored.
  * [gh-112919](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112919): Speed-up [`datetime.datetime.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.replace "datetime.datetime.replace"), [`datetime.date.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.replace "datetime.date.replace") and [`datetime.time.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time.replace "datetime.time.replace").
  * [gh-59013](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/59013): Set breakpoint on the first executable line of the function, instead of the line of function definition when the user do `break func` using [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  * [gh-112343](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112343): Improve handling of pdb convenience variables to avoid replacing string contents.
  * [gh-112240](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112240): Add option to calendar module CLI to specify the weekday to start each week. Patch by Steven Ward.
  * [gh-111741](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111741): Recognise `image/webp` as a standard format in the [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types.") module.
  * [gh-43457](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/43457): Fix the [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") widget method `wm_attributes()`.

### Documentation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id24 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-126622](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126622): Added stub pages for removed modules explaining their removal, where to find replacements, and linking to the last Python version that supported them. Contributed by Ned Batchelder.
  * [gh-125277](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125277): Require Sphinx 7.2.6 or later to build the Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
  * [gh-124872](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124872): Added definitions for [context](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-context), [current context](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-current-context), and [context management protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-context-management-protocol), updated related definitions to be consistent, and expanded the documentation for [`contextvars.Context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context").
  * [gh-125018](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125018): The [`importlib.metadata`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#module-importlib.metadata "importlib.metadata: Accessing package metadata") documentation now includes semantic cross-reference targets for the significant documented APIs. This means intersphinx references like [`importlib.metadata.version()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#importlib.metadata.version "importlib.metadata.version") will now work as expected.
  * [gh-70870](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/70870): Clarified the dual usage of the term “free variable” (both the formal meaning of any reference to names defined outside the local scope, and the narrower pragmatic meaning of nonlocal variables named in `co_freevars`).
  * [gh-121277](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121277): Writers of CPython’s documentation can now use `next` as the version for the `versionchanged`, `versionadded`, `deprecated` directives.
  * [gh-60712](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/60712): Include the [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object") type in the lists of documented types. Change by Furkan Onder and Martin Panter.
  * [bpo-34008](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34008): The [`Py_Main()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_Main "Py_Main") documentation moved from the “Very High Level API” section to the “Initialization and Finalization” section.
Also make it explicit that we expect `Py_Main` to typically be called instead of `Py_Initialize` rather than after it (since `Py_Main` makes its own call to `Py_Initialize`). Document that calling both is supported but is version dependent on which settings will be applied correctly.

Title: Linear Regression in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html
Summary: This section demonstrates the usage of linear regression in Python using the 'linear_regression()' function and explains the case of fitting a line through the origin when _proportional_ is true. It provides an example predicting the number of films released based on the year and refers to a model predicting orbital distances based on the orbital periods of dwarf planets.
---

```
>>> year = [1971, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1983]
>>> films_total = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> slope, intercept = linear_regression(year, films_total)
>>> round(slope * 2019 + intercept)
16

```

If _proportional_ is true, the independent variable _x_ and the dependent variable _y_ are assumed to be directly proportional. The data is fit to a line passing through the origin. Since the _intercept_ will always be 0.0, the underlying linear function simplifies to:
> _y = slope * x + noise_
Continuing the example from [`correlation()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.correlation "statistics.correlation"), we look to see how well a model based on major planets can predict the orbital distances for dwarf planets:
>>>```
>>> model = linear_regression(period_squared, dist_cubed, proportional=True)
>>> slope = model.slope
>>> # Dwarf planets:  Pluto, Eris,  Makemake, Haumea, Ceres
>>> orbital_periods = [90_560, 204_199, 111_845, 103_410, 1_680] # days
>>> predicted_dist = [math.cbrt(slope * (p * p)) for p in orbital_periods]
>>> list(map(round, predicted_dist))
[5912, 10166, 6806, 6459, 414]
>>> [5_906, 10_152, 6_796, 6_450, 414] # actual distance in million km
[5906, 10152, 6796, 6450, 414]

```

Added in version 3.10.
Changed in version 3.11: Added support for _proportional_.
## Exceptions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#exceptions "Link to this heading")
A single exception is defined: 

_exception_ statistics.StatisticsError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.StatisticsError "Link to this definition")
    
Subclass of [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") for statistics-related exceptions.
## [`NormalDist`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist "statistics.NormalDist") objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#normaldist-objects "Link to this heading")
[`NormalDist`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist "statistics.NormalDist") is a tool for creating and manipulating normal distributions of a [random variable](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/ranvar.htm). It is a class that treats the mean and standard deviation of data measurements as a single entity.
Normal distributions arise from the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) and have a wide range of applications in statistics. 

_class_ statistics.NormalDist(_mu =0.0_, _sigma =1.0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a new _NormalDist_ object where _mu_ represents the [arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) and _sigma_ represents the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation).
If _sigma_ is negative, raises [`StatisticsError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.StatisticsError "statistics.StatisticsError"). 

mean[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist.mean "Link to this definition")
    
A read-only property for the [arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of a normal distribution. 

median[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist.median "Link to this definition")
    
A read-only property for the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of a normal distribution. 

mode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist.mode "Link to this definition")
    
A read-only property for the [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\)) of a normal distribution. 

stdev[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist.stdev "Link to this definition")
    
A read-only property for the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of a normal distribution. 

variance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist.variance "Link to this definition")
    
A read-only property for the [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of a normal distribution. Equal to the square of the standard deviation.

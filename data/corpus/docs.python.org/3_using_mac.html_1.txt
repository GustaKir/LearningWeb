Summary: This document provides an overview of macOS-specific considerations for getting started with Python on Mac computers. It discusses the similarities to Python on other Unix-derived platforms and outlines various methods for obtaining and installing Python, particularly focusing on versions provided by the CPython release team from the python.org website.

# 5. Using Python on macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#using-python-on-macos "Link to this heading")
This document aims to give an overview of macOS-specific behavior you should know about to get started with Python on Mac computers. Python on a Mac running macOS is very similar to Python on other Unix-derived platforms, but there are some differences in installation and some features.
There are various ways to obtain and install Python for macOS. Pre-built versions of the most recent versions of Python are available from a number of distributors. Much of this document describes use of the Pythons provided by the CPython release team for download from the [python.org website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). See [Alternative Distributions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#alternative-bundles) for some other options.
## 5.1. Using Python for macOS from `python.org`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#using-python-for-macos-from-python-org "Link to this heading")
### 5.1.1. Installation steps[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#installation-steps "Link to this heading")
For [current Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (other than those in `security` status), the release team produces a **Python for macOS** installer package for each new release. A list of available installers is available [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/). We recommend using the most recent supported Python version where possible. Current installers provide a [universal2 binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary) build of Python which runs natively on all Macs (Apple Silicon and Intel) that are supported by a wide range of macOS versions, currently typically from at least **macOS 10.13 High Sierra** on.
The downloaded file is a standard macOS installer package file (`.pkg`). File integrity information (checksum, size, sigstore signature, etc) for each file is included on the release download page. Installer packages and their contents are signed and notarized with `Python Software Foundation` Apple Developer ID certificates to meet [macOS Gatekeeper requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).
For a default installation, double-click on the downloaded installer package file. This should launch the standard macOS Installer app and display the first of several installer windows steps.

Clicking on the **Continue** button brings up the **Read Me** for this installer. Besides other important information, the **Read Me** documents which Python version is going to be installed and on what versions of macOS it is supported. You may need to scroll through to read the whole file. By default, this **Read Me** will also be installed in `/Applications/Python 3.13/` and available to read anytime.

Clicking on **Continue** proceeds to display the license for Python and for other included software. You will then need to **Agree** to the license terms before proceeding to the next step. This license file will also be installed and available to be read later.

After the license terms are accepted, the next step is the **Installation Type** display. For most uses, the standard set of installation operations is appropriate.

By pressing the **Customize** button, you can choose to omit or select certain package components of the installer. Click on each package name to see a description of what it installs. To also install support for the optional experimental free-threaded feature, see [Installing Free-threaded Binaries](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#install-freethreaded-macos).

In either case, clicking **Install** will begin the install process by asking permission to install new software. A macOS user name with `Administrator` privilege is needed as the installed Python will be available to all users of the Mac.
When the installation is complete, the **Summary** window will appear.
![../_images/mac_installer_06_summary.png](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/mac_installer_06_summary.png)
Double-click on the **Install Certificates.command** icon or file in the `/Applications/Python 3.13/` window to complete the installation.

This will open a temporary **Terminal** shell window that will use the new Python to download and install SSL root certificates for its use.

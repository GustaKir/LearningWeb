Title: os.sysconf_names and os.curdir in the os Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: This section describes the `os.sysconf_names` dictionary, which maps names acceptable by `sysconf()` to integer values defined by the host operating system, and notes its availability on Unix. It mentions the addition of the 'SC_MINSIGSTKSZ' name in version 3.11. Additionally, it introduces `os.curdir`, a constant string that represents the current directory, denoted as '.' on Windows.

os.sysconf_names[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sysconf_names "Link to this definition")
    
Dictionary mapping names accepted by [`sysconf()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sysconf "os.sysconf") to the integer values defined for those names by the host operating system. This can be used to determine the set of names known to the system.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix.
Changed in version 3.11: Add `'SC_MINSIGSTKSZ'` name.
The following data values are used to support path manipulation operations. These are defined for all platforms.
Higher-level operations on pathnames are defined in the [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames.") module. 

os.curdir[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.curdir "Link to this definition")
    
The constant string used by the operating system to refer to the current directory. This is `'.'` for Windows and POSIX. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.pardir[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pardir "Link to this definition")
    
The constant string used by the operating system to refer to the parent directory. This is `'..'` for Windows and POSIX. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.sep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sep "Link to this definition")
    
The character used by the operating system to separate pathname components. This is `'/'` for POSIX and `'\\'` for Windows. Note that knowing this is not sufficient to be able to parse or concatenate pathnames — use [`os.path.split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.split "os.path.split") and [`os.path.join()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join "os.path.join") — but it is occasionally useful. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.altsep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.altsep "Link to this definition")
    
An alternative character used by the operating system to separate pathname components, or `None` if only one separator character exists. This is set to `'/'` on Windows systems where `sep` is a backslash. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.extsep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.extsep "Link to this definition")
    
The character which separates the base filename from the extension; for example, the `'.'` in `os.py`. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.pathsep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pathsep "Link to this definition")
    
The character conventionally used by the operating system to separate search path components (as in `PATH`), such as `':'` for POSIX or `';'` for Windows. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.defpath[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.defpath "Link to this definition")
    
The default search path used by [`exec*p*`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl "os.execl") and [`spawn*p*`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.spawnl "os.spawnl") if the environment doesn’t have a `'PATH'` key. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames."). 

os.linesep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.linesep "Link to this definition")
    
The string used to separate (or, rather, terminate) lines on the current platform. This may be a single character, such as `'\n'` for POSIX, or multiple characters, for example, `'\r\n'` for Windows. Do not use _os.linesep_ as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode (the default); use a single `'\n'` instead, on all platforms. 

os.devnull[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.devnull "Link to this definition")
    
The file path of the null device. For example: `'/dev/null'` for POSIX, `'nul'` for Windows. Also available via [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames.").

Title: Python 3 Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Key updates include deprecating `typing.Hashable` and `typing.Sized` aliases, relocating an undocumented `python -m pprint` benchmark to the `pprint` pyperformance suite, and fixing an issue with subclassing complex generics in the `typing` module that caused misleading error messages.

The function call performs I/O and CPU intensive work.
  * [gh-94309](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94309): Deprecate aliases [`typing.Hashable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Hashable "typing.Hashable") and [`typing.Sized`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sized "typing.Sized")
  * [gh-92546](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92546): An undocumented `python -m pprint` benchmark is moved into `pprint` suite of pyperformance. Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
  * [gh-94607](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94607): Fix subclassing complex generics with type variables in [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\)."). Previously an error message saying `Some type variables ... are not listed in Generic[...]` was shown. [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints \(see :pep:`484`\).") no longer populates `__parameters__` with the `__parameters__` of a Python class.
  * [gh-94619](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94619): Remove the long-deprecated `module_repr()` from [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.").
  * [gh-93910](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93910): The ability to access the other values of an enum on an enum (e.g. `Color.RED.BLUE`) has been restored in order to fix a performance regression.
  * [gh-93896](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93896): Fix [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") and [`unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase "unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase") to always the set event loop as it was done in Python 3.10 and earlier. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-94343](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94343): Allow setting the attributes of `reprlib.Repr` during object initialization
  * [gh-94382](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94382): Port static types of `_multiprocessing` module to heap types. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-78724](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/78724): Fix crash in [`struct.Struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct "struct.Struct") when it was not completely initialized by initializing it in [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__"). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-94510](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94510): Re-entrant calls to [`sys.setprofile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setprofile "sys.setprofile") and [`sys.settrace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace "sys.settrace") now raise [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [gh-92336](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92336): Fix bug where [`linecache.getline()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/linecache.html#linecache.getline "linecache.getline") fails on bad files with [`UnicodeDecodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError "UnicodeDecodeError") or [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError"). It now returns an empty string as per the documentation.
  * [gh-94398](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94398): Once a [`asyncio.TaskGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup") has started shutting down (i.e., at least one task has failed and the task group has started cancelling the remaining tasks), it should not be possible to add new tasks to the task group.
  * [gh-94383](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94383): `xml.etree`: Remove the `ElementTree.Element.copy()` method of the pure Python implementation, deprecated in Python 3.10, use the [`copy.copy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.copy "copy.copy") function instead. The C implementation of `xml.etree` has no `copy()` method, only a `__copy__()` method. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-94379](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94379): [`zipimport`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives."): Remove `find_loader()` and `find_module()` methods, deprecated in Python 3.10: use the `find_spec()` method instead. See [**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) for the rationale.

Title: Using the `namer` Attribute in BaseRotatingHandler
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html
Summary: The `namer` attribute in `BaseRotatingHandler` can be set to a callable, which is used by the `rotation_filename()` method during log rollover. It's important for this function to be efficient and consistent to ensure correct rollover behavior.

namer[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.namer "Link to this definition")
    
If this attribute is set to a callable, the [`rotation_filename()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename "logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename") method delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those passed to [`rotation_filename()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename "logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename").
Note
The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover, so it should be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also return the same output every time for a given input, otherwise the rollover behaviour may not work as expected.
It’s also worth noting that care should be taken when using a namer to preserve certain attributes in the filename which are used during rotation. For example, [`RotatingFileHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler "logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler") expects to have a set of log files whose names contain successive integers, so that rotation works as expected, and [`TimedRotatingFileHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler "logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler") deletes old log files (based on the `backupCount` parameter passed to the handler’s initializer) by determining the oldest files to delete. For this to happen, the filenames should be sortable using the date/time portion of the filename, and a namer needs to respect this. (If a namer is wanted that doesn’t respect this scheme, it will need to be used in a subclass of [`TimedRotatingFileHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler "logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler") which overrides the [`getFilesToDelete()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler.getFilesToDelete "logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler.getFilesToDelete") method to fit in with the custom naming scheme.)
Added in version 3.3. 

rotator[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotator "Link to this definition")
    
If this attribute is set to a callable, the [`rotate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotate "logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotate") method delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those passed to [`rotate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotate "logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotate").
Added in version 3.3. 

rotation_filename(_default_name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename "Link to this definition")
    
Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.
This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.
The default implementation calls the ‘namer’ attribute of the handler, if it’s callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn’t callable (the default is `None`), the name is returned unchanged. 

Parameters:
    
**default_name** – The default name for the log file.
Added in version 3.3. 

rotate(_source_ , _dest_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.rotate "Link to this definition")
    
When rotating, rotate the current log.
The default implementation calls the ‘rotator’ attribute of the handler, if it’s callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the attribute isn’t callable (the default is `None`), the source is simply renamed to the destination. 

Parameters:
    
  * **source** – The source filename. This is normally the base filename, e.g. ‘test.log’.
  * **dest** – The destination filename. This is normally what the source is rotated to, e.g. ‘test.log.1’.

SimpleQueue.empty() under _spawn_ and _forkserver_ start methods.
  * [bpo-30329](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30329): imaplib and poplib now catch the Windows socket WSAEINVAL error (code 10022) on shutdown(SHUT_RDWR): An invalid operation was attempted. This error occurs sometimes on SSL connections.
  * [bpo-30375](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30375): Warnings emitted when compile a regular expression now always point to the line in the user code. Previously they could point into inners of the re module if emitted from inside of groups or conditionals.
  * [bpo-30048](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30048): Fixed `Task.cancel()` can be ignored when the task is running coroutine and the coroutine returned without any more `await`.
  * [bpo-29990](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29990): Fix range checking in GB18030 decoder. Original patch by Ma Lin.
  * [bpo-26293](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26293): Change resulted because of zipfile breakage. (See also: [bpo-29094](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29094))
  * [bpo-30243](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30243): Removed the __init__ methods of _json’s scanner and encoder. Misusing them could cause memory leaks or crashes. Now scanner and encoder objects are completely initialized in the __new__ methods.
  * [bpo-30185](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30185): Avoid KeyboardInterrupt tracebacks in forkserver helper process when Ctrl-C is received.
  * [bpo-28556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28556): Various updates to typing module: add typing.NoReturn type, use WrapperDescriptorType, minor bug-fixes. Original PRs by Jim Fasarakis-Hilliard and Ivan Levkivskyi.
  * [bpo-30205](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30205): Fix getsockname() for unbound AF_UNIX sockets on Linux.
  * [bpo-30070](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30070): Fixed leaks and crashes in errors handling in the parser module.
  * [bpo-30061](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30061): Fixed crashes in IOBase methods __next__() and readlines() when readline() or __next__() respectively return non-sizeable object. Fixed possible other errors caused by not checking results of PyObject_Size(), PySequence_Size(), or PyMapping_Size().
  * [bpo-30068](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30068): _io._IOBase.readlines will check if it’s closed first when hint is present.
  * [bpo-29694](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29694): Fixed race condition in pathlib mkdir with flags parents=True. Patch by Armin Rigo.
  * [bpo-29692](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29692): Fixed arbitrary unchaining of RuntimeError exceptions in contextlib.contextmanager. Patch by Siddharth Velankar.
  * [bpo-29998](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29998): Pickling and copying ImportError now preserves name and path attributes.
  * [bpo-29942](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29942): Fix a crash in itertools.chain.from_iterable when encountering long runs of empty iterables.
  * [bpo-27863](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27863): Fixed multiple crashes in ElementTree caused by race conditions and wrong types.
  * [bpo-28699](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28699): Fixed a bug in pools in multiprocessing.pool that raising an exception at the very first of an iterable may swallow the exception or make the program hang. Patch by Davin Potts and Xiang Zhang.
  * [bpo-25803](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25803): Avoid incorrect errors raised by Path.mkdir(exist_ok=True) when the OS gives priority to errors such as EACCES over EEXIST.
  * [bpo-29861](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29861): Release references to tasks, their arguments and their results as soon as they are finished in multiprocessing.Pool.
  * [bpo-29884](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29884): faulthandler: Restore the old sigaltstack during teardown. Patch by Christophe Zeitouny.

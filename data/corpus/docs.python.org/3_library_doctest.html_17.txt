Title: DocTest Configuration and Globals
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
Summary: This section discusses the behavior of the module parameter in doctest, specifically when set to False, and how globals for DocTests are constructed. It explains that when _module_ is False or None, all objects are treated as belonging to a non-existent module, impacting the search for doctests. It also details the combination of _globs_ and _extraglobs_ to form the globals dictionary for each DocTest, including default values for these parameters.
---

If _module_ is `False`, no attempt to find the module will be made. This is obscure, of use mostly in testing doctest itself: if _module_ is `False`, or is `None` but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.
The globals for each [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") is formed by combining _globs_ and _extraglobs_ (bindings in _extraglobs_ override bindings in _globs_). A new shallow copy of the globals dictionary is created for each [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest"). If _globs_ is not specified, then it defaults to the module’s ___dict___ , if specified, or `{}` otherwise. If _extraglobs_ is not specified, then it defaults to `{}`.
### DocTestParser objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctestparser-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ doctest.DocTestParser[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestParser "Link to this definition")
    
A processing class used to extract interactive examples from a string, and use them to create a [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object.
[`DocTestParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") defines the following methods: 

get_doctest(_string_ , _globs_ , _name_ , _filename_ , _lineno_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestParser.get_doctest "Link to this definition")
    
Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and collect them into a [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object.
_globs_ , _name_ , _filename_ , and _lineno_ are attributes for the new [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object. See the documentation for [`DocTest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") for more information. 

get_examples(_string_ , _name ='<string>'_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestParser.get_examples "Link to this definition")
    
Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return them as a list of [`Example`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") objects. Line numbers are 0-based. The optional argument _name_ is a name identifying this string, and is only used for error messages. 

parse(_string_ , _name ='<string>'_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestParser.parse "Link to this definition")
    
Divide the given string into examples and intervening text, and return them as a list of alternating [`Example`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "doctest.Example")s and strings. Line numbers for the [`Example`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.Example "doctest.Example")s are 0-based. The optional argument _name_ is a name identifying this string, and is only used for error messages.
### TestResults objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#testresults-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ doctest.TestResults(_failed_ , _attempted_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.TestResults "Link to this definition")
     

failed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.TestResults.failed "Link to this definition")
    
Number of failed tests. 

attempted[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.TestResults.attempted "Link to this definition")
    
Number of attempted tests. 

skipped[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.TestResults.skipped "Link to this definition")
    
Number of skipped tests.
Added in version 3.13.
### DocTestRunner objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctestrunner-objects "Link to this heading")

Title: ZipFile.read() Method
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html
Summary: The `read()` method of the ZipFile class returns the bytes of a specified file from the archive. It requires the archive to be opened for reading or appending and can accept an optional password for encrypted files, which can override a default password. The method can handle files represented by both names and ZipInfo objects.

ZipFile.read(_name_ , _pwd =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.read "Link to this definition")
    
Return the bytes of the file _name_ in the archive. _name_ is the name of the file in the archive, or a [`ZipInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "zipfile.ZipInfo") object. The archive must be open for read or append. _pwd_ is the password used for encrypted files as a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object and, if specified, overrides the default password set with [`setpassword()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.setpassword "zipfile.ZipFile.setpassword"). Calling [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.read "zipfile.ZipFile.read") on a ZipFile that uses a compression method other than [`ZIP_STORED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_STORED "zipfile.ZIP_STORED"), [`ZIP_DEFLATED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED "zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED"), [`ZIP_BZIP2`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2 "zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2") or [`ZIP_LZMA`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_LZMA "zipfile.ZIP_LZMA") will raise a [`NotImplementedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError"). An error will also be raised if the corresponding compression module is not available.
Changed in version 3.6: Calling [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.read "zipfile.ZipFile.read") on a closed ZipFile will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Previously, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised. 

ZipFile.testzip()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.testzip "Link to this definition")
    
Read all the files in the archive and check their CRC’s and file headers. Return the name of the first bad file, or else return `None`.
Changed in version 3.6: Calling [`testzip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.testzip "zipfile.ZipFile.testzip") on a closed ZipFile will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Previously, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised. 

ZipFile.write(_filename_ , _arcname =None_, _compress_type =None_, _compresslevel =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.write "Link to this definition")
    
Write the file named _filename_ to the archive, giving it the archive name _arcname_ (by default, this will be the same as _filename_ , but without a drive letter and with leading path separators removed). If given, _compress_type_ overrides the value given for the _compression_ parameter to the constructor for the new entry. Similarly, _compresslevel_ will override the constructor if given. The archive must be open with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.
Note
The ZIP file standard historically did not specify a metadata encoding, but strongly recommended CP437 (the original IBM PC encoding) for interoperability. Recent versions allow use of UTF-8 (only). In this module, UTF-8 will automatically be used to write the member names if they contain any non-ASCII characters. It is not possible to write member names in any encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8.
Note
Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is, they should not start with a path separator.
Note
If `arcname` (or `filename`, if `arcname` is not given) contains a null byte, the name of the file in the archive will be truncated at the null byte.
Note
A leading slash in the filename may lead to the archive being impossible to open in some zip programs on Windows systems.
Changed in version 3.6: Calling [`write()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.write "zipfile.ZipFile.write") on a ZipFile created with mode `'r'` or a closed ZipFile will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Previously, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised.

Title: Python Forking Behavior and Function Registration
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: This section explains the function calls associated with the `fork()` operation in Python. It details that functions registered before forking are executed in reverse order, while those registered after are executed in the order they were registered. It also highlights that third-party C code may not invoke these functions unless specific API calls are made.
---

These calls are only made if control is expected to return to the Python interpreter. A typical [`subprocess`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess "subprocess: Subprocess management.") launch will not trigger them as the child is not going to re-enter the interpreter.
Functions registered for execution before forking are called in reverse registration order. Functions registered for execution after forking (either in the parent or in the child) are called in registration order.
Note that `fork()` calls made by third-party C code may not call those functions, unless it explicitly calls [`PyOS_BeforeFork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_BeforeFork "PyOS_BeforeFork"), [`PyOS_AfterFork_Parent()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_AfterFork_Parent "PyOS_AfterFork_Parent") and [`PyOS_AfterFork_Child()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_AfterFork_Child "PyOS_AfterFork_Child").
There is no way to unregister a function.

Title: Command Line Options: Site and Buffering
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html
Summary: This section describes two command line options for Python: '-S' disables the import of the 'site' module and its manipulations of 'sys.path', while '-u' forces stdout and stderr to be unbuffered, affecting only output streams.
---

-S[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-S "Link to this definition")
    
Disable the import of the module [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") and the site-dependent manipulations of [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") that it entails. Also disable these manipulations if [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") is explicitly imported later (call [`site.main()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.main "site.main") if you want them to be triggered). 

-u[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u "Link to this definition")
    
Force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered. This option has no effect on the stdin stream.
See also [`PYTHONUNBUFFERED`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED).
Changed in version 3.7: The text layer of the stdout and stderr streams now is unbuffered. 

-v[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-v "Link to this definition")
    
Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice (`-vv`), print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.
Changed in version 3.10: The [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module reports the site-specific paths and `.pth` files being processed.
See also [`PYTHONVERBOSE`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONVERBOSE). 

-W arg[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W "Link to this definition")
    
Warning control. Python’s warning machinery by default prints warning messages to [`sys.stderr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stderr "sys.stderr").
The simplest settings apply a particular action unconditionally to all warnings emitted by a process (even those that are otherwise ignored by default):
```
-Wdefault# Warn once per call location
-Werror# Convert to exceptions
-Walways# Warn every time
-Wall# Same as -Walways
-Wmodule# Warn once per calling module
-Wonce# Warn once per Python process
-Wignore# Never warn

```

The action names can be abbreviated as desired and the interpreter will resolve them to the appropriate action name. For example, `-Wi` is the same as `-Wignore`.
The full form of argument is:
```
action:message:category:module:lineno

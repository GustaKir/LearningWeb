Title: ZipFile.extract Method
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html
Summary: The ZipFile.extract method extracts a specified member from a zip archive to the current working directory or a specified path. The member must either be its full name or a ZipInfo object. Optionally, a password can be provided for encrypted files. The method returns the normalized path of the extracted file or directory, adjusting for absolute paths.

ZipFile.extract(_member_ , _path =None_, _pwd =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extract "Link to this definition")
    
Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory; _member_ must be its full name or a [`ZipInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "zipfile.ZipInfo") object. Its file information is extracted as accurately as possible. _path_ specifies a different directory to extract to. _member_ can be a filename or a [`ZipInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "zipfile.ZipInfo") object. _pwd_ is the password used for encrypted files as a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object.
Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).
Note
If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: `///foo/bar` becomes `foo/bar` on Unix, and `C:\foo\bar` becomes `foo\bar` on Windows. And all `".."` components in a member filename will be removed, e.g.: `../../foo../../ba..r` becomes `foo../ba..r`. On Windows illegal characters (`:`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `"`, `?`, and `*`) replaced by underscore (`_`).
Changed in version 3.6: Calling [`extract()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extract "zipfile.ZipFile.extract") on a closed ZipFile will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Previously, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised.
Changed in version 3.6.2: The _path_ parameter accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object). 

ZipFile.extractall(_path =None_, _members =None_, _pwd =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extractall "Link to this definition")
    
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory. _path_ specifies a different directory to extract to. _members_ is optional and must be a subset of the list returned by [`namelist()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.namelist "zipfile.ZipFile.namelist"). _pwd_ is the password used for encrypted files as a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object.
Warning
Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of _path_ , e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with `"/"` or filenames with two dots `".."`. This module attempts to prevent that. See [`extract()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extract "zipfile.ZipFile.extract") note.
Changed in version 3.6: Calling [`extractall()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extractall "zipfile.ZipFile.extractall") on a closed ZipFile will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Previously, a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised.

ZipFile.printdir()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.printdir "Link to this definition")
    
Print a table of contents for the archive to `sys.stdout`. 

ZipFile.setpassword(_pwd_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.setpassword "Link to this definition")
    
Set _pwd_ (a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object) as default password to extract encrypted files.

Title: Python 3.11 Release Notes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html
Summary: This section discusses the resolution of long-standing bugs affecting capture groups, which may alter captured output in specific cases. Additionally, it introduces build changes, highlighting PEP 11's Tier 3 support for cross-compiling Python for WebAssembly platforms, including Emscripten and WASI, inspired by previous efforts like Pyodide.
---

several long-standing bugs where fixed that, in rare cases, could cause capture groups to get the wrong result. Therefore, this could change the captured output in these cases. (Contributed by Ma Lin in [bpo-35859](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35859).)


## Build Changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#build-changes "Link to this heading")
  * CPython now has [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) [**Tier 3 support**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3) for cross compiling to the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) platforms [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) (`wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, i.e. Python in the browser) and [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](https://wasi.dev/) (`wasm32-unknown-wasi`). The effort is inspired by previous work like [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). These platforms provide a limited subset of POSIX APIs; Python standard libraries features and modules related to networking, processes, threading, signals, mmap, and users/groups are not available or don’t work. (Emscripten contributed by Christian Heimes and Ethan Smith in [gh-84461](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84461) and WASI contributed by Christian Heimes in [gh-90473](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90473); platforms promoted in [gh-95085](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95085))
  * Building CPython now requires:
    * A [C11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/11) compiler and standard library. [Optional C11 features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_\(C_standard_revision\)#Optional_features) are not required. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-46656](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46656), [bpo-45440](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45440) and [bpo-46640](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46640).)
    * Support for [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point numbers. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-46917](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46917).)
  * The `Py_NO_NAN` macro has been removed. Since CPython now requires IEEE 754 floats, NaN values are always available. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-46656](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46656).)
  * The [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") package now requires [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk) version 8.5.12 or newer. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-46996](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46996).)
  * Build dependencies, compiler flags, and linker flags for most stdlib extension modules are now detected by **configure**. libffi, libnsl, libsqlite3, zlib, bzip2, liblzma, libcrypt, Tcl/Tk, and uuid flags are detected by [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) (when available). [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") now requires a pkg-config command to detect development settings for [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk) headers and libraries. (Contributed by Christian Heimes and Erlend Egeberg Aasland in [bpo-45847](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45847), [bpo-45747](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45747), and [bpo-45763](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45763).)
  * libpython is no longer linked against libcrypt. (Contributed by Mike Gilbert in [bpo-45433](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45433).)
  * CPython can now be built with the [ThinLTO](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html) option via passing `thin` to [`--with-lto`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-lto), i.e. `--with-lto=thin`. (Contributed by Donghee Na and Brett Holman in [bpo-44340](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44340).)
  * Freelists for object structs can now be disabled. A new **configure** option [`--without-freelists`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-freelists) can be used to disable all freelists except empty tuple singleton. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [bpo-45522](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45522).)
  * `Modules/Setup` and `Modules/makesetup` have been improved and tied up. Extension modules can now be built through `makesetup`. All except some test modules can be linked statically into a main binary or library. (Contributed by Brett Cannon and Christian Heimes in [bpo-45548](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45548), [bpo-45570](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45570), [bpo-45571](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45571), and [bpo-43974](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43974).)

Use the environment variables `TCLTK_CFLAGS` and `TCLTK_LIBS` to manually specify the location of Tcl/Tk headers and libra

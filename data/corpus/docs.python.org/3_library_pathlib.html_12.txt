Title: Pathlib's Glob Method Behavior
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html
Summary: The 'glob' method in pathlib matches paths based on platform-specific casing rules by default, which can be overridden using the _case_sensitive_ argument. It also follows symlinks unless specified otherwise with the _recurse_symlinks_ argument. Notable changes include the addition of these parameters in versions 3.12 and 3.13.

By default, or when the _case_sensitive_ keyword-only argument is set to `None`, this method matches paths using platform-specific casing rules: typically, case-sensitive on POSIX, and case-insensitive on Windows. Set _case_sensitive_ to `True` or `False` to override this behaviour.
By default, or when the _recurse_symlinks_ keyword-only argument is set to `False`, this method follows symlinks except when expanding “`**`” wildcards. Set _recurse_symlinks_ to `True` to always follow symlinks.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `pathlib.Path.glob` with arguments `self`, `pattern`.
Changed in version 3.12: The _case_sensitive_ parameter was added.
Changed in version 3.13: The _recurse_symlinks_ parameter was added.
Changed in version 3.13: The _pattern_ parameter accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).
Changed in version 3.13: Any [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") exceptions raised from scanning the filesystem are suppressed. In previous versions, such exceptions are suppressed in many cases, but not all. 

Path.rglob(_pattern_ , _*_ , _case_sensitive =None_, _recurse_symlinks =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.rglob "Link to this definition")
    
Glob the given relative _pattern_ recursively. This is like calling [`Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") with “`**/`” added in front of the _pattern_.

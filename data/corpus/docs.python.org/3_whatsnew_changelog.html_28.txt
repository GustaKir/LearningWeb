Title: Python Library Enhancements and Fixes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: The `argparse` module is recommended for parsing command-line arguments, unless specific concerns with `optparse` arise. The changelog includes fixes for issues related to `tokenize.untokenize()`, `NamespaceReader`, and updated support in the `http.cookies` module for parsing RFC 850 date formats.
---

Of the three, `argparse` remains the recommended default choice, _unless_ one of the concerns noted at the top of the `optparse` module documentation applies.
  * [gh-125553](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125553): Fix round-trip invariance for backslash continuations in [`tokenize.untokenize()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html#tokenize.untokenize "tokenize.untokenize").
  * [gh-123987](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123987): Fixed issue in NamespaceReader where a non-path item in a namespace path, such as a sentinel added by an editable installer, would break resource loading.
  * [gh-123401](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123401): The [`http.cookies`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#module-http.cookies "http.cookies: Support for HTTP state management \(cookies\).") module now supports parsing obsolete [**RFC 850**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc850.html) date formats, in accordance with [**RFC 9110**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110.html) requirements. Patch by Nano Zheng.
  * [gh-122431](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122431): [`readline.append_history_file()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#readline.append_history_file "readline.append_history_file") now raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") when given a negative value.
  * [gh-119257](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119257): Show tab completions menu below the current line, which results in less janky behaviour, and fixes a cursor movement bug. Patch by Daniel Hollas


### Documentation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id13 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-125722](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125722): Require Sphinx 8.1.3 or later to build the Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
  * [gh-67206](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/67206): Document that [`string.printable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.printable "string.printable") is not printable in the POSIX sense. In particular, [`string.printable.isprintable()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isprintable "str.isprintable") returns [`False`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False "False"). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.

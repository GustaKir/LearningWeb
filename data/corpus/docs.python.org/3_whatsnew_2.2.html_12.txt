Title: Python 2.2 Release Notes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.2.html
Summary: Python 2.2 introduces the SimpleXMLRPCServer module for creating XML-RPC servers, the new hmac module for HMAC implementation, and enhancements in several functions that now return pseudo-sequences with mnemonic attributes.
---

```

The [`SimpleXMLRPCServer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html#module-xmlrpc.server "xmlrpc.server: Basic XML-RPC server implementations.") module makes it easy to create straightforward XML-RPC servers. See <http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/> for more information about XML-RPC.
  * The new [`hmac`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#module-hmac "hmac: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication \(HMAC\) implementation") module implements the HMAC algorithm described by [**RFC 2104**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104.html). (Contributed by Gerhard Häring.)
  * Several functions that originally returned lengthy tuples now return pseudo-sequences that still behave like tuples but also have mnemonic attributes such as `memberst_mtime` or [`tm_year`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_year "time.struct_time.tm_year"). The enhanced functions include [`stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat"), [`fstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstat "os.fstat"), [`statvfs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.statvfs "os.statvfs"), and [`fstatvfs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstatvfs "os.fstatvfs") in the [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") module, and [`localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime"), [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime"), and [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") in the [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module.
For example, to obtain a file’s size using the old tuples, you’d end up writing something like `file_size = os.stat(filename)[stat.ST_SIZE]`, but now this can be written more clearly as `file_size = os.stat(filename).st_size`.
The original patch for this feature was contributed by Nick Mathewson.
  * The Python profiler has been extensively reworked and various errors in its output have been corrected. (Contributed by Fred L. Drake, Jr. and Tim Peters.)
  * The [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") module can be compiled to support IPv6; specify the `--enable-ipv6` option to Python’s configure script. (Contributed by Jun-ichiro “itojun” Hagino.)
  * Two new format characters were added to the [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#module-struct "struct: Interpret bytes as packed binary data.") module for 64-bit integers on platforms that support the C longlong type. `q` is for a signed 64-bit integer, and `Q` is for an unsigned one. The value is returned in Python’s long integer type. (Contributed by Tim Peters.)
  * In the interpreter’s interactive mode, there’s a new built-in function [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help "help") that uses the [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") module introduced in Python 2.1 to provide interactive help. `help(object)` displays any available help text about _object_. [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help "help") with no argument puts you in an online help utility, where you can enter the names of functions, classes, or modules to read their help text. (Contributed by Guido van Rossum, using Ka-Ping Yee’s [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") module.)
  * Various bugfixes and performance improvements have been made to the SRE engine underlying the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") module. For example, the [`re.sub()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub "re.sub") and [`re.split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split "re.split") functions have been rewritten in C. Another contributed patch speeds up certain Unicode character ranges by a factor of two, and a new [`finditer()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer "re.finditer") method that returns an iterator over all the non-overlapping matches in a given string. (SRE is maintained by Fredrik Lundh. The BIGCHARSET patch was contributed by Martin von Löwis.)
  * The [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") module now supports [**RFC 2487**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2487.html), “Secure SMTP over TLS”, so it’s now possible to encrypt the SMTP traffic between a Python program and the mail transport agent being handed a message. [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") also supports SMTP

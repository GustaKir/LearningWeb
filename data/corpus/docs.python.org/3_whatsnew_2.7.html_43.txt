Title: Python 2.7.9 Features from PEP 466
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html
Summary: Python 2.7.9 introduces features from PEP 466, including significant enhancements to the `ssl` module, such as support for Server Name Indication and TLS1.x settings, as well as caching improvements for `os.urandom()`. These changes improve security and performance, with contributions from Alex Gaynor and David Reid.

[**PEP 466**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0466/) related features added in Python 2.7.9:
  * Most of Python 3.4’s [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") module was backported. This means [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") now supports Server Name Indication, TLS1.x settings, access to the platform certificate store, the [`SSLContext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext "ssl.SSLContext") class, and other features.

Refer to the “Version added: 2.7.9” notes in the module documentation for specific details.
  * [`os.urandom()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom") was changed to cache a file descriptor to `/dev/urandom` instead of reopening `/dev/urandom` on every call. (Contributed by Alex Gaynor; [bpo-21305](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21305).)
  * [`hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed "hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed") and [`hashlib.algorithms_available`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.algorithms_available "hashlib.algorithms_available") were backported from Python 3 to make it easier for Python 2 applications to select the strongest available hash algorithm.

# `curses.panel` — A panel stack extension for curses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#module-curses.panel "Link to this heading")
Panels are windows with the added feature of depth, so they can be stacked on top of each other, and only the visible portions of each window will be displayed. Panels can be added, moved up or down in the stack, and removed.
## Functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#functions "Link to this heading")
The module [`curses.panel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#module-curses.panel "curses.panel: A panel stack extension that adds depth to curses windows.") defines the following functions: 

curses.panel.bottom_panel()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.bottom_panel "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the bottom panel in the panel stack. 

curses.panel.new_panel(_win_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.new_panel "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a panel object, associating it with the given window _win_. Be aware that you need to keep the returned panel object referenced explicitly. If you don’t, the panel object is garbage collected and removed from the panel stack. 

curses.panel.top_panel()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.top_panel "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the top panel in the panel stack. 

curses.panel.update_panels()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.update_panels "Link to this definition")
    
Updates the virtual screen after changes in the panel stack. This does not call [`curses.doupdate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.doupdate "curses.doupdate"), so you’ll have to do this yourself.
## Panel Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#panel-objects "Link to this heading")
Panel objects, as returned by [`new_panel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.new_panel "curses.panel.new_panel") above, are windows with a stacking order. There’s always a window associated with a panel which determines the content, while the panel methods are responsible for the window’s depth in the panel stack.
Panel objects have the following methods: 

Panel.above()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.above "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the panel above the current panel. 

Panel.below()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.panel.html#curses.panel.Panel.below "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the panel below the current panel.

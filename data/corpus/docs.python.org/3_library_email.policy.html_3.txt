Title: Email Policy Class in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html
Summary: The `email.policy.Policy` class serves as an abstract base class for email policy implementations, providing default methods and supporting immutability. It accepts various keyword arguments during instantiation, allowing customization of its properties, which override default values.

_class_ email.policy.Policy(_** kw_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy "Link to this definition")
    
This is the [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) for all policy classes. It provides default implementations for a couple of trivial methods, as well as the implementation of the immutability property, the [`clone()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.clone "email.policy.Policy.clone") method, and the constructor semantics.
The constructor of a policy class can be passed various keyword arguments. The arguments that may be specified are any non-method properties on this class, plus any additional non-method properties on the concrete class. A value specified in the constructor will override the default value for the corresponding attribute.
This class defines the following properties, and thus values for the following may be passed in the constructor of any policy class: 

max_line_length[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.max_line_length "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum length of any line in the serialized output, not counting the end of line character(s). Default is 78, per [**RFC 5322**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322.html). A value of `0` or [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") indicates that no line wrapping should be done at all. 

linesep[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.linesep "Link to this definition")
    
The string to be used to terminate lines in serialized output. The default is `\n` because that’s the internal end-of-line discipline used by Python, though `\r\n` is required by the RFCs. 

cte_type[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.cte_type "Link to this definition")
    
Controls the type of Content Transfer Encodings that may be or are required to be used. The possible values are:
`7bit` | all data must be “7 bit clean” (ASCII-only). This means that where necessary data will be encoded using either quoted-printable or base64 encoding.  
---|---  
`8bit` | data is not constrained to be 7 bit clean. Data in headers is still required to be ASCII-only and so will be encoded (see [`fold_binary()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.fold_binary "email.policy.Policy.fold_binary") and [`utf8`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.EmailPolicy.utf8 "email.policy.EmailPolicy.utf8") below for exceptions), but body parts may use the `8bit` CTE.  
A `cte_type` value of `8bit` only works with `BytesGenerator`, not `Generator`, because strings cannot contain binary data. If a `Generator` is operating under a policy that specifies `cte_type=8bit`, it will act as if `cte_type` is `7bit`. 

raise_on_defect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.raise_on_defect "Link to this definition")
    
If [`True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True "True"), any defects encountered will be raised as errors. If [`False`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False "False") (the default), defects will be passed to the [`register_defect()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.register_defect "email.policy.Policy.register_defect") method. 

mangle_from_[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.mangle_from_ "Link to this definition")
    
If [`True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True "True"), lines starting with _“From “_ in the body are escaped by putting a `>` in front of them. This parameter is used when the message is being serialized by a generator. Default: [`False`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False "False").
Added in version 3.5. 

message_factory[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#email.policy.Policy.message_factory "Link to this definition")
    
A factory function for constructing a new empty message object. Used by the parser when building messages. Defaults to `None`, in which case [`Message`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.compat32-message.html#email.message.Message "email.message.Message") is used.
Added in version 3.6.

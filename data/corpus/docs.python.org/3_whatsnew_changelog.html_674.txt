### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id677 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-27477](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27477): IDLE search dialogs now use ttk widgets.
  * [bpo-27173](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27173): Add ‘IDLE Modern Unix’ to the built-in key sets. Make the default key set depend on the platform. Add tests for the changes to the config module.
  * [bpo-27452](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27452): make command line “idle-test> python test_help.py” work. __file__ is relative when python is started in the file’s directory.
  * [bpo-27452](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27452): add line counter and crc to IDLE configHandler test dump.
  * [bpo-27380](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27380): IDLE: add query.py with base Query dialog and ttk widgets. Module had subclasses SectionName, ModuleName, and HelpSource, which are used to get information from users by configdialog and file =>Load Module. Each subclass has itw own validity checks. Using ModuleName allows users to edit bad module names instead of starting over. Add tests and delete the two files combined into the new one.
  * [bpo-27372](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27372): Test_idle no longer changes the locale.
  * [bpo-27365](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27365): Allow non-ascii chars in IDLE NEWS.txt, for contributor names.
  * [bpo-27245](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27245): IDLE: Cleanly delete custom themes and key bindings. Previously, when IDLE was started from a console or by import, a cascade of warnings was emitted. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.
  * [bpo-24137](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24137): Run IDLE, test_idle, and htest with tkinter default root disabled. Fix code and tests that fail with this restriction. Fix htests to not create a second and redundant root and mainloop.
  * [bpo-27310](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27310): Fix IDLE.app failure to launch on OS X due to vestigial import.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id678 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-26754](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26754): PyUnicode_FSDecoder() accepted a filename argument encoded as an iterable of integers. Now only strings and byte-like objects are accepted.


### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id679 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-28066](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28066): Fix the logic that searches build directories for generated include files when building outside the source tree.
  * [bpo-27442](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27442): Expose the Android API level that python was built against, in sysconfig.get_config_vars() as ‘ANDROID_API_LEVEL’.
  * [bpo-27434](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27434): The interpreter that runs the cross-build, found in PATH, must now be of the same feature version (e.g. 3.6) as the source being built.
  * [bpo-26930](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26930): Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2h.
  * [bpo-23968](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23968): Rename the platform directory from plat-$(MACHDEP) to plat-$(PLATFORM_TRIPLET). Rename the config directory (LIBPL) from config-$(LDVERSION) to config-$(LDVERSION)-$(PLATFORM_TRIPLET). Install the platform specific _sysconfigdata module into the platform directory and rename it to include the ABIFLAGS.
  * Don’t use largefile support for GNU/Hurd.

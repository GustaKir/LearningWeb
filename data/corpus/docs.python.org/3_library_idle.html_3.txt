Title: IDLE Features and Debugger Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html
Summary: This section describes features in IDLE, including the ability to access source lines from exceptions and file references, activating the debugger for code execution, viewing stack traces of exceptions, and configuring options for the Shell and Editor.
---

Go to File/Line
    
Look on the current line. with the cursor, and the line above for a filename and line number. If found, open the file if not already open, and show the line. Use this to view source lines referenced in an exception traceback and lines found by Find in Files. Also available in the context menu of the Shell window and Output windows. 

Debugger (toggle)
    
When activated, code entered in the Shell or run from an Editor will run under the debugger. In the Editor, breakpoints can be set with the context menu. This feature is still incomplete and somewhat experimental. 

Stack Viewer
    
Show the stack traceback of the last exception in a tree widget, with access to locals and globals. 

Auto-open Stack Viewer
    
Toggle automatically opening the stack viewer on an unhandled exception.
### Options menu (Shell and Editor)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#options-menu-shell-and-editor "Link to this heading") 

Configure IDLE
    
Open a configuration dialog and change preferences for the following: fonts, indentation, keybindings, text color themes, startup windows and size, additional help sources, and extensions. On macOS, open the configuration dialog by selecting Preferences in the application menu. For more details, see [Setting preferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#preferences) under Help and preferences.
Most configuration options apply to all windows or all future windows. The option items below only apply to the active window. 

Show/Hide Code Context (Editor Window only)
    
Open a pane at the top of the edit window which shows the block context of the code which has scrolled above the top of the window. See [Code Context](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#code-context) in the Editing and Navigation section below. 

Show/Hide Line Numbers (Editor Window only)
    
Open a column to the left of the edit window which shows the number of each line of text. The default is off, which may be changed in the preferences (see [Setting preferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#preferences)). 

Zoom/Restore Height
    
Toggles the window between normal size and maximum height. The initial size defaults to 40 lines by 80 chars unless changed on the General tab of the Configure IDLE dialog. The maximum height for a screen is determined by momentarily maximizing a window the first time one is zoomed on the screen. Changing screen settings may invalidate the saved height. This toggle has no effect when a window is maximized.
### Window menu (Shell and Editor)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#window-menu-shell-and-editor "Link to this heading")
Lists the names of all open windows; select one to bring it to the foreground (deiconifying it if necessary).
### Help menu (Shell and Editor)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#help-menu-shell-and-editor "Link to this heading") 

About IDLE
    
Display version, copyright, license, credits, and more. 

IDLE Help
    
Display this IDLE document, detailing the menu options, basic editing and navigation, and other tips. 

Python Docs
    
Access local Python documentation, if installed, or start a web browser and open docs.python.org showing the latest Python documentation. 

Turtle Demo
    
Run the turtledemo module with example Python code and turtle drawings.
Additional help sources may be added here with the Configure IDLE dialog under the General tab. See the [Help sources](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#help-sources) subsection below for more on Help menu choices.
### Context menus[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#context-menus "Link to this heading")
Open a context menu by right-clicking in a window (Control-click on macOS). Context menus have the standard clipboard functions also on the Edit menu. 

Cut
    
Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard; then delete the selection. 

Copy
    
Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard. 

Paste
    
Insert contents of the system-wide clipboard into the current window.
Editor windows also have breakpoint functions. Lines with a breakpoint set are specially marked. Breakpoints only have an effect when running under the debugger. Breakpoints for a file are saved in the user’s `.idlerc` directory. 

Set Breakpoint
    
Set a breakpoint on the current line. 

Clear Breakpoint
    
Clear the breakpoint on that line.
Shell and Output windows also have the following. 

Go to file/line
    
Same as in Debug menu.
The Shell window also has an output squeezing facility explained in the _Python Shell window_ subsection below.

Title: Email Header Registry - Group Representation
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html
Summary: This section describes how a `Group` can be used to represent single email addresses alongside groups. A `Group` can have a `display_name`, which, if set to `None`, indicates it represents a single address if only one address is present in the `addresses` tuple.
---

```

As a convenience for processing lists of addresses that consist of a mixture of groups and single addresses, a `Group` may also be used to represent single addresses that are not part of a group by setting _display_name_ to `None` and providing a list of the single address as _addresses_. 

display_name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group.display_name "Link to this definition")
    
The `display_name` of the group. If it is `None` and there is exactly one `Address` in `addresses`, then the `Group` represents a single address that is not in a group. 

addresses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group.addresses "Link to this definition")
    
A possibly empty tuple of [`Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Address "email.headerregistry.Address") objects representing the addresses in the group. 

__str__()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group.__str__ "Link to this definition")
    
The `str` value of a `Group` is formatted according to [**RFC 5322**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322.html), but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII characters. If `display_name` is none and there is a single `Address` in the `addresses` list, the `str` value will be the same as the `str` of that single `Address`.

Title: unittest.TextTestRunner Class
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
Summary: The unittest.TextTestRunner class is a basic implementation of a test runner that outputs results to a specified stream, defaulting to sys.stderr. It supports configurable parameters but remains straightforward. Graphical applications running test suites should implement alternate versions that can accommodate future changes in the unittest framework.

_class_ unittest.TextTestRunner(_stream =None_, _descriptions =True_, _verbosity =1_, _failfast =False_, _buffer =False_, _resultclass =None_, _warnings =None_, _*_ , _tb_locals =False_, _durations =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner "Link to this definition")
    
A basic test runner implementation that outputs results to a stream. If _stream_ is `None`, the default, [`sys.stderr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") is used as the output stream. This class has a few configurable parameters, but is essentially very simple. Graphical applications which run test suites should provide alternate implementations. Such implementations should accept `**kwargs` as the interface to construct runners changes when features are added to unittest.
By default this runner shows [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"), [`PendingDeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PendingDeprecationWarning "PendingDeprecationWarning"), [`ResourceWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ResourceWarning "ResourceWarning") and [`ImportWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning") even if they are [ignored by default](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-ignored). This behavior can be overridden using Python’s `-Wd` or `-Wa` options (see [Warning control](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-warnings)) and leaving _warnings_ to `None`.
Changed in version 3.2: Added the _warnings_ parameter.
Changed in version 3.2: The default stream is set to [`sys.stderr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") at instantiation time rather than import time.
Changed in version 3.5: Added the _tb_locals_ parameter.
Changed in version 3.12: Added the _durations_ parameter. 

_makeResult()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner._makeResult "Link to this definition")
    
This method returns the instance of `TestResult` used by [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner.run "unittest.TextTestRunner.run"). It is not intended to be called directly, but can be overridden in subclasses to provide a custom `TestResult`.
`_makeResult()` instantiates the class or callable passed in the `TextTestRunner` constructor as the `resultclass` argument. It defaults to [`TextTestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestResult "unittest.TextTestResult") if no `resultclass` is provided. The result class is instantiated with the following arguments:
```
stream, descriptions, verbosity

```


run(_test_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner.run "Link to this definition")
    
This method is the main public interface to the `TextTestRunner`. This method takes a [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") or [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instance. A [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") is created by calling [`_makeResult()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner._makeResult "unittest.TextTestRunner._makeResult") and the test(s) are run and the results printed to stdout. 

unittest.main(_module ='__main__'_, _defaultTest =None_, _argv =None_, _testRunner =None_, _testLoader =unittest.defaultTestLoader_, _exit =True_, _verbosity =1_, _failfast =None_, _catchbreak =None_, _buffer =None_, _warnings =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.main "Link to this definition")
    
A command-line program that loads a set of tests from _module_ and runs them; this is primarily for making test modules conveniently executable. The simplest use for this function is to include the following line at the end of a test script:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main()

```

You can run tests with more detailed information by passing in the verbosity argument:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main(verbosity=2)

Title: Test Support Functions in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html
Summary: This section describes several utility functions in Python's test.support module, including checking if a resource is enabled, determining if Python is optimized, checking pymalloc support, and a decorator for resource requirements.
---

```


test.support.is_resource_enabled(_resource_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.is_resource_enabled "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if _resource_ is enabled and available. The list of available resources is only set when [`test.regrtest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#module-test.regrtest "test.regrtest: Drives the regression test suite.") is executing the tests. 

test.support.python_is_optimized()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.python_is_optimized "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if Python was not built with `-O0` or `-Og`. 

test.support.with_pymalloc()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.with_pymalloc "Link to this definition")
    
Return `_testcapi.WITH_PYMALLOC`. 

test.support.requires(_resource_ , _msg =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.requires "Link to this definition")
    
Raise [`ResourceDenied`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.ResourceDenied "test.support.ResourceDenied") if _resource_ is not available. _msg_ is the argument to [`ResourceDenied`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.ResourceDenied "test.support.ResourceDenied") if it is raised. Always returns `True` if called by a function whose `__name__` is `'__main__'`. Used when tests are executed by [`test.regrtest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#module-test.regrtest "test.regrtest: Drives the regression test suite."). 

test.support.sortdict(_dict_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.sortdict "Link to this definition")
    
Return a repr of _dict_ with keys sorted. 

test.support.findfile(_filename_ , _subdir =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.findfile "Link to this definition")
    
Return the path to the file named _filename_. If no match is found _filename_ is returned. This does not equal a failure since it could be the path to the file.
Setting _subdir_ indicates a relative path to use to find the file rather than looking directly in the path directories. 

test.support.get_pagesize()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.get_pagesize "Link to this definition")
    
Get size of a page in bytes.
Added in version 3.12. 

test.support.setswitchinterval(_interval_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.setswitchinterval "Link to this definition")
    
Set the [`sys.setswitchinterval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setswitchinterval "sys.setswitchinterval") to the given _interval_. Defines a minimum interval for Android systems to prevent the system from hanging. 

test.support.check_impl_detail(_** guards_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.check_impl_detail "Link to this definition")
    
Use this check to guard CPython’s implementation-specific tests or to run them only on the implementations guarded by the arguments. This function returns `True` or `False` depending on the host platform. Example usage:
```
check_impl_detail()        # Only on CPython (default).
check_impl_detail(jython=True)  # Only on Jython.
check_impl_detail(cpython=False) # Everywhere except CPython.

Title: Deprecated Functions and Platform Support in Python 3.7
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html
Summary: The `PyOS_AfterFork()` function has been deprecated in favor of `PyOS_BeforeFork()`, `PyOS_AfterFork_Parent()`, and `PyOS_AfterFork_Child()`. Additionally, official support for FreeBSD 9 and older has been removed, and *nix platforms must now provide at least one of `C.UTF-8` or similar for full Unicode support.

[`PyOS_AfterFork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_AfterFork "PyOS_AfterFork") has been deprecated. Use [`PyOS_BeforeFork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_BeforeFork "PyOS_BeforeFork"), [`PyOS_AfterFork_Parent()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_AfterFork_Parent "PyOS_AfterFork_Parent") or [`PyOS_AfterFork_Child()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_AfterFork_Child "PyOS_AfterFork_Child") instead.

## Platform Support Removals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#platform-support-removals "Link to this heading")
  * FreeBSD 9 and older are no longer officially supported.
  * For full Unicode support, including within extension modules, *nix platforms are now expected to provide at least one of `C.UTF-8` (full locale), `C.utf8` (full locale) or `UTF-8` (`LC_CTYPE`-only locale) as an alternative to the legacy `ASCII`-based `C` locale.
  * OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.1 are no longer supported, which means building CPython 3.7 with SSL/TLS support on older platforms still using these versions requires custom build options that link to a more recent version of OpenSSL.
Notably, this issue affects the Debian 8 (aka “jessie”) and Ubuntu 14.04 (aka “Trusty”) LTS Linux distributions, as they still use OpenSSL 1.0.1 by default.
Debian 9 (“stretch”) and Ubuntu 16.04 (“xenial”), as well as recent releases of other LTS Linux releases (e.g. RHEL/CentOS 7.5, SLES 12-SP3), use OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, and remain supported in the default build configuration.
CPython’s own [CI configuration file](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.13/.travis.yml) provides an example of using the SSL [compatibility testing infrastructure](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Tools/ssl/multissltests.py) in CPython’s test suite to build and link against OpenSSL 1.1.0 rather than an outdated system provided OpenSSL.

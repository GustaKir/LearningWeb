Title: Decimal Arithmetic Recommendations
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
Summary: It is advised to set tighter bounds and implement the 'Inexact' trap for calculations expected to be exact, particularly on systems without overallocation. Updates in versions 3.3 and 3.9 are noted regarding handling exact results, especially non-integer powers.

```

In general (and especially on systems without overallocation), it is recommended to estimate even tighter bounds and set the [`Inexact`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Inexact "decimal.Inexact") trap if all calculations are expected to be exact.
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#id2)]
Added in version 3.3.
[[2](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#id3)]
Changed in version 3.9: This approach now works for all exact results except for non-integer powers.

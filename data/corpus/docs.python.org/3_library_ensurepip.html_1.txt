Title: Installation Locations for pip
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html
Summary: The `pip` installation location can be adjusted using the `--root` option to specify a directory or the `--user` option to install into the user site packages directory. By default, `pip` installs into the current virtual environment or system site packages.
---

```

By default, `pip` is installed into the current virtual environment (if one is active) or into the system site packages (if there is no active virtual environment). The installation location can be controlled through two additional command line options: 

--root <dir>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#cmdoption-ensurepip-root "Link to this definition")
    
Installs `pip` relative to the given root directory rather than the root of the currently active virtual environment (if any) or the default root for the current Python installation. 

--user[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#cmdoption-ensurepip-user "Link to this definition")
    
Installs `pip` into the user site packages directory rather than globally for the current Python installation (this option is not permitted inside an active virtual environment).
By default, the scripts `pipX` and `pipX.Y` will be installed (where X.Y stands for the version of Python used to invoke `ensurepip`). The scripts installed can be controlled through two additional command line options: 

--altinstall[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#cmdoption-ensurepip-altinstall "Link to this definition")
    
If an alternate installation is requested, the `pipX` script will _not_ be installed. 

--default-pip[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#cmdoption-ensurepip-default-pip "Link to this definition")
    
If a “default pip” installation is requested, the `pip` script will be installed in addition to the two regular scripts.
Providing both of the script selection options will trigger an exception.
## Module API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-api "Link to this heading")
[`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "ensurepip: Bootstrapping the "pip" installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.") exposes two functions for programmatic use: 

ensurepip.version()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#ensurepip.version "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a string specifying the available version of pip that will be installed when bootstrapping an environment. 

ensurepip.bootstrap(_root =None_, _upgrade =False_, _user =False_, _altinstall =False_, _default_pip =False_, _verbosity =0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#ensurepip.bootstrap "Link to this definition")
    
Bootstraps `pip` into the current or designated environment.
_root_ specifies an alternative root directory to install relative to. If _root_ is `None`, then installation uses the default install location for the current environment.
_upgrade_ indicates whether or not to upgrade an existing installation of an earlier version of `pip` to the available version.
_user_ indicates whether to use the user scheme rather than installing globally.
By default, the scripts `pipX` and `pipX.Y` will be installed (where X.Y stands for the current version of Python).
If _altinstall_ is set, then `pipX` will _not_ be installed.
If _default_pip_ is set, then `pip` will be installed in addition to the two regular scripts.
Setting both _altinstall_ and _default_pip_ will trigger [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").
_verbosity_ controls the level of output to [`sys.stdout`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout "sys.stdout") from the bootstrapping operation.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `ensurepip.bootstrap` with argument `root`.
Note
The bootstrapping process has side effects on both `sys.path` and `os.environ`. Invoking the command line interface in a subprocess instead allows these side effects to be avoided.
Note
The bootstrapping process may install additional modules required by `pip`, but other software should not assume those dependencies will always be present by default (as the dependencies may be removed in a future version of `pip`).

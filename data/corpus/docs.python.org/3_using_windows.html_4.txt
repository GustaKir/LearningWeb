Title: Modifying a Python Installation on Windows
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
Summary: This section explains how to modify an installed Python version on Windows via the Programs and Features tool. Users can add or remove features, repair the installation, or uninstall Python entirely, with certain limitations on changing the install directory.

### 4.1.5. Modifying an install[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#modifying-an-install "Link to this heading")
Once Python has been installed, you can add or remove features through the Programs and Features tool that is part of Windows. Select the Python entry and choose “Uninstall/Change” to open the installer in maintenance mode.
“Modify” allows you to add or remove features by modifying the checkboxes - unchanged checkboxes will not install or remove anything. Some options cannot be changed in this mode, such as the install directory; to modify these, you will need to remove and then reinstall Python completely.
“Repair” will verify all the files that should be installed using the current settings and replace any that have been removed or modified.
“Uninstall” will remove Python entirely, with the exception of the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher), which has its own entry in Programs and Features.
### 4.1.6. Installing Free-threaded Binaries[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-free-threaded-binaries "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.13: (Experimental)
Note
Everything described in this section is considered experimental, and should be expected to change in future releases.
To install pre-built binaries with free-threading enabled (see [**PEP 703**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)), you should select “Customize installation”. The second page of options includes the “Download free-threaded binaries” checkbox.
![../_images/win_install_freethreaded.png](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/win_install_freethreaded.png)
Selecting this option will download and install additional binaries to the same location as the main Python install. The main executable is called `python3.13t.exe`, and other binaries either receive a `t` suffix or a full ABI suffix. Python source files and bundled third-party dependencies are shared with the main install.
The free-threaded version is registered as a regular Python install with the tag `3.13t` (with a `-32` or `-arm64` suffix as normal for those platforms). This allows tools to discover it, and for the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) to support `py.exe -3.13t`. Note that the launcher will interpret `py.exe -3` (or a `python3` shebang) as “the latest 3.x install”, which will prefer the free-threaded binaries over the regular ones, while `py.exe -3.13` will not. If you use the short style of option, you may prefer to not install the free-threaded binaries at this time.
To specify the install option at the command line, use `Include_freethreaded=1`. See [Installing Without Downloading](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#install-layout-option) for instructions on pre-emptively downloading the additional binaries for offline install. The options to include debug symbols and binaries also apply to the free-threaded builds.
Free-threaded binaries are also available [on nuget.org](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#windows-nuget).
## 4.2. The Microsoft Store package[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.7.2.
The Microsoft Store package is an easily installable Python interpreter that is intended mainly for interactive use, for example, by students.
To install the package, ensure you have the latest Windows 10 updates and search the Microsoft Store app for “Python 3.13”. Ensure that the app you select is published by the Python Software Foundation, and install it.
Warning
Python will always be available for free on the Microsoft Store. If you are asked to pay for it, you have not selected the correct package.
After installation, Python may be launched by finding it in Start. Alternatively, it will be available from any Command Prompt or PowerShell session by typing `python`. Further, pip and IDLE may be used by typing `pip` or `idle`. IDLE can also be found in Start.
All three commands are also available with version number suffixes, for example, as `python3.exe` and `python3.x.exe` as well as `python.exe` (where `3.x` is the specific version you want to launch, such as 3.13). Open “Manage App Execution Aliases” through Start to select which version of Python is associated with each command. It is recommended to make sure that `pip` and `idle` are consistent with whichever version of `python` is selected.
Virtual environments can be created with `python -m venv` and activated and used as normal.
If you have installed another version of Python and added it to your `PATH` variable, it will be available as `python.exe` rather than the one from the Microsoft Store. To access the new installation, use `python3.exe` or `python3.x.exe`.
The `py.exe` launcher will detect this Python installation, but will prefer installations from the traditional installer.

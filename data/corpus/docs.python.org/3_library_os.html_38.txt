Title: OS Module - File Status Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: This section discusses changes in the `os.stat()` function and its behavior across different Python versions, including the introduction of `_dir_fd_` and `_follow_symlinks_` parameters in version 3.3, support for path-like objects in version 3.6, and modifications in version 3.8 regarding reparse points on Windows.

[`fstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstat "os.fstat") and [`lstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.lstat "os.lstat") functions.
Changed in version 3.3: Added the _dir_fd_ and _follow_symlinks_ parameters, specifying a file descriptor instead of a path.
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).
Changed in version 3.8: On Windows, all reparse points that can be resolved by the operating system are now followed, and passing `follow_symlinks=False` disables following all name surrogate reparse points. If the operating system reaches a reparse point that it is not able to follow, _stat_ now returns the information for the original path as if `follow_symlinks=False` had been specified instead of raising an error. 

_class_ os.stat_result[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result "Link to this definition")
    
Object whose attributes correspond roughly to the members of the `stat` structure. It is used for the result of [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat"), [`os.fstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fstat "os.fstat") and [`os.lstat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.lstat "os.lstat").
Attributes: 

st_mode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_mode "Link to this definition")
    
File mode: file type and file mode bits (permissions). 

st_ino[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_ino "Link to this definition")
    
Platform dependent, but if non-zero, uniquely identifies the file for a given value of `st_dev`. Typically:
  * the inode number on Unix,
  * the [file index](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363788) on Windows



st_dev[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_dev "Link to this definition")
    
Identifier of the device on which this file resides. 

st_nlink[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_nlink "Link to this definition")
    
Number of hard links. 

st_uid[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_uid "Link to this definition")
    
User identifier of the file owner. 

st_gid[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_gid "Link to this definition")
    
Group identifier of the file owner. 

st_size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_size "Link to this definition")
    
Size of the file in bytes, if it is a regular file or a symbolic link. The size of a symbolic link is the length of the pathname it contains, without a terminating null byte.
Timestamps: 

st_atime[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_atime "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent access expressed in seconds. 

st_mtime[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_mtime "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent content modification expressed in seconds. 

st_ctime[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_ctime "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent metadata change expressed in seconds.
Changed in version 3.12: `st_ctime` is deprecated on Windows. Use `st_birthtime` for the file creation time. In the future, `st_ctime` will contain the time of the most recent metadata change, as for other platforms. 

st_atime_ns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_atime_ns "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent access expressed in nanoseconds as an integer.
Added in version 3.3. 

st_mtime_ns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_mtime_ns "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent content modification expressed in nanoseconds as an integer.
Added in version 3.3. 

st_ctime_ns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_ctime_ns "Link to this definition")
    
Time of most recent metadata change expressed in nanoseconds as an integer.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.12: `st_ctime_ns` is deprecated on Windows. Use `st_birthtime_ns` for the file creation time. In the future, `st_ctime` will contain the time of the most recent metadata change, as for other platforms. 

st_birthtime[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result.st_birthtime "Link to this definition")
    
Time of file creation expressed in seconds. This attribute is not always available, and may raise [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError").
Changed in version 3.12: `st_birthtime` is now available on Windows.

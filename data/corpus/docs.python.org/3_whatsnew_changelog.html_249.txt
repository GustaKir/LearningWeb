Summary: This document highlights recent changes in Python, including the status of `os.chmod()` as a dummy function on WASI, modifications to test coverage for `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar.formatweekday()`, and various issues addressed in test procedures such as skipping symlink tests and fixing tests that fail with optimizations.

2)` syscall. [`os.chmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod "os.chmod") is now a dummy function on WASI. Skip all tests that depend on working [`os.chmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod "os.chmod").
  * [gh-90473](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90473): Skip tests on WASI that require symlinks with absolute paths.
  * [gh-57539](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/57539): Increase calendar test coverage for `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar.formatweekday()`.
  * [gh-90473](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90473): Skip symlink tests on WASI. wasmtime uses `openat2(2)` with `RESOLVE_BENEATH` flag, which prevents symlinks with absolute paths.
  * [gh-89858](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89858): Fix `test_embed` for out-of-tree builds. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-92886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92886): Fixing tests that fail when running with optimizations (`-O`) in `test_imaplib.py`.
  * [gh-92886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92886): Fixing tests that fail when running with optimizations (`-O`) in `test_zipimport.py`
  * [gh-92886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92886): Fixing tests that fail when running with optimizations (`-O`) in `test_py_compile.py`
  * [gh-92886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92886): Fixing tests that fail when running with optimizations (`-O`) in `test_sys_settrace.py`.
  * [gh-92886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92886): Fixing tests that fail when running with optimizations (`-O`) in `_test_multiprocessing.py`
  * [gh-92670](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92670): Skip `test_shutil.TestCopy.test_copyfile_nonexistent_dir` test on AIX as the test uses a trailing slash to force the OS consider the path as a directory, but on AIX the trailing slash has no effect and is considered as a file.
  * [gh-92514](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92514): Remove unused `test.support.BasicTestRunner`. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-47016](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=47016): Create a GitHub Actions workflow for verifying bundled pip and setuptools. Patch by Illia Volochii and Adam Turner.

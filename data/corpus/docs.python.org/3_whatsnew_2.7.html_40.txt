Title: Porting to Python 2.7
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html
Summary: This section details changes and bugfixes in Python 2.7 that may necessitate updates to existing code, including modifications to the `range()` function and the `format()` method's default precision for floating-point numbers.

## Porting to Python 2.7[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#porting-to-python-2-7 "Link to this heading")
This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that may require changes to your code:
  * The [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range "range") function processes its arguments more consistently; it will now call [`__int__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "object.__int__") on non-float, non-integer arguments that are supplied to it. (Fixed by Alexander Belopolsky; [bpo-1533](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1533).)
  * The string [`format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format") method changed the default precision used for floating-point and complex numbers from 6 decimal places to 12, which matches the precision used by [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"). (Changed by Eric Smith; [bpo-5920](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5920).)
  * Because of an optimization for the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement, the special methods [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") and [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") must belong to the object’s type, and cannot be directly attached to the object’s instance. This affects new-style classes (derived from [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object")) and C extension types. ([bpo-6101](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6101).)
  * Due to a bug in Python 2.6, the _exc_value_ parameter to [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") methods was often the string representation of the exception, not an instance. This was fixed in 2.7, so _exc_value_ will be an instance as expected. (Fixed by Florent Xicluna; [bpo-7853](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=7853).)
  * When a restricted set of attributes were set using `__slots__`, deleting an unset attribute would not raise [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") as you would expect. Fixed by Benjamin Peterson; [bpo-7604](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=7604).)

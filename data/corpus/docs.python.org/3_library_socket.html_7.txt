socket.AF_PACKET[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.AF_PACKET "Link to this definition")


socket.PF_PACKET[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.PF_PACKET "Link to this definition")


PACKET_*
    
Many constants of these forms, documented in the Linux documentation, are also defined in the socket module.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.2. 

socket.ETH_P_ALL[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.ETH_P_ALL "Link to this definition")
    
`ETH_P_ALL` can be used in the [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket "socket.socket") constructor as _proto_ for the [`AF_PACKET`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.AF_PACKET "socket.AF_PACKET") family in order to capture every packet, regardless of protocol.
For more information, see the _[packet(7)](https://manpages.debian.org/packet\(7\))_ manpage.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux.
Added in version 3.12. 

socket.AF_RDS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.AF_RDS "Link to this definition")


socket.PF_RDS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.PF_RDS "Link to this definition")


socket.SOL_RDS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.SOL_RDS "Link to this definition")

Constants for Windows’ WSAIoctl(). The constants are used as arguments to the [`ioctl()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.ioctl "socket.socket.ioctl") method of socket objects.
Changed in version 3.6: `SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH` was added. 

TIPC_*
    
TIPC related constants, matching the ones exported by the C socket API. See the TIPC documentation for more information.

Title: IPv6 Address Representations
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html
Summary: This section describes the different representations of IPv6 addresses: 'compressed', which omits leading zeroes and collapses zero groups, and 'exploded', which includes all zeroes and groups. It also mentions the 'packed' representation and provides references to the IPv4Address class documentation.

compressed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.compressed "Link to this definition")

The short form of the address representation, with leading zeroes in groups omitted and the longest sequence of groups consisting entirely of zeroes collapsed to a single empty group.
This is also the value returned by `str(addr)` for IPv6 addresses. 

exploded[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.exploded "Link to this definition")

The long form of the address representation, with all leading zeroes and groups consisting entirely of zeroes included.
For the following attributes and methods, see the corresponding documentation of the [`IPv4Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") class: 

packed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.packed "Link to this definition")

version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.version "Link to this definition")


max_prefixlen[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.max_prefixlen "Link to this definition")


is_multicast[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_multicast "Link to this definition")


is_private[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_private "Link to this definition")


is_global[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_global "Link to this definition")
    
Added in version 3.4. 

is_unspecified[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_unspecified "Link to this definition")


is_reserved[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_reserved "Link to this definition")


is_loopback[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_loopback "Link to this definition")


is_link_local[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_link_local "Link to this definition")


is_site_local[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_site_local "Link to this definition")
    
`True` if the address is reserved for site-local usage. Note that the site-local address space has been deprecated by [**RFC 3879**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3879.html). Use [`is_private`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private "ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private") to test if this address is in the space of unique local addresses as defined by [**RFC 4193**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193.html). 

ipv4_mapped[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped "Link to this definition")
    
For addresses that appear to be IPv4 mapped addresses (starting with `::FFFF/96`), this property will report the embedded IPv4 address. For any other address, this property will be `None`. 

scope_id[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.scope_id "Link to this definition")
    
For scoped addresses as defined by [**RFC 4007**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4007.html), this property identifies the particular zone of the address’s scope that the address belongs to, as a string. When no scope zone is specified, this property will be `None`. 

sixtofour[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.sixtofour "Link to this definition")
    
For addresses that appear to be 6to4 addresses (starting with `2002::/16`) as defined by [**RFC 3056**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3056.html), this property will report the embedded IPv4 address. For any other address, this property will be `None`. 

teredo[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Address.teredo "Link to this definition")
    
For addresses that appear to be Teredo addresses (starting with `2001::/32`) as defined by [**RFC 4380**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4380.html), this property will report the embedded `(server, client)` IP address pair. For any other address, this property will be `None`.

Title: Using the Python Issue Tracker
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html
Summary: This section explains how to submit issue reports for Python using the GitHub issues tracker. It emphasizes the importance of checking for previously reported problems to avoid redundancy and possibly gain insights on existing fixes or information needed.

## Using the Python issue tracker[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#using-the-python-issue-tracker "Link to this heading")
Issue reports for Python itself should be submitted via the GitHub issues tracker (<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues>). The GitHub issues tracker offers a web form which allows pertinent information to be entered and submitted to the developers.
The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has already been reported. The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the developers’ time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!). To do this, search the tracker using the search box at the top of the page.
If the problem you’re reporting is not already in the list, log in to GitHub. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, create a new account using the “Sign up” link. It is not possible to submit a bug report anonymously.
Being now logged in, you can submit an issue. Click on the “New issue” button in the top bar to report a new issue.
The submission form has two fields, “Title” and “Comment”.
For the “Title” field, enter a _very_ short description of the problem; fewer than ten words is good.
In the “Comment” field, describe the problem in detail, including what you expected to happen and what did happen. Be sure to include whether any extension modules were involved, and what hardware and software platform you were using (including version information as appropriate).
Each issue report will be reviewed by a developer who will determine what needs to be done to correct the problem. You will receive an update each time an action is taken on the issue.

## Getting started contributing to Python yourself[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#getting-started-contributing-to-python-yourself "Link to this heading")
Beyond just reporting bugs that you find, you are also welcome to submit patches to fix them. You can find more information on how to get started patching Python in the [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/). If you have questions, the [core-mentorship mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/core-mentorship.python.org/) is a friendly place to get answers to any and all questions pertaining to the process of fixing issues in Python.

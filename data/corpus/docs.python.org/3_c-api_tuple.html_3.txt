Title: PyStructSequence_Desc Structure Documentation
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html
Summary: The PyStructSequence_Desc structure defines attributes for creating a new structure type in Python, including the fully qualified name, a docstring pointer, an array of field names, and the number of fields visible to Python.
---

constchar*name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc.name "Link to this definition")
    
Fully qualified name of the type; null-terminated UTF-8 encoded. The name must contain the module name. 

constchar*doc[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc.doc "Link to this definition")
    
Pointer to docstring for the type or `NULL` to omit. 

[PyStructSequence_Field](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Field "PyStructSequence_Field")*fields[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc.fields "Link to this definition")
    
Pointer to `NULL`-terminated array with field names of the new type. 

intn_in_sequence[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc.n_in_sequence "Link to this definition")
    
Number of fields visible to the Python side (if used as tuple). 

typePyStructSequence_Field[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Field "Link to this definition")
    _Part of the[ Stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable) (including all members)._
Describes a field of a struct sequence. As a struct sequence is modeled as a tuple, all fields are typed as [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*. The index in the [`fields`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc.fields "PyStructSequence_Desc.fields") array of the [`PyStructSequence_Desc`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Desc "PyStructSequence_Desc") determines which field of the struct sequence is described. 

constchar*name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Field.name "Link to this definition")
    
Name for the field or `NULL` to end the list of named fields, set to [`PyStructSequence_UnnamedField`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_UnnamedField "PyStructSequence_UnnamedField") to leave unnamed. 

constchar*doc[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_Field.doc "Link to this definition")
    
Field docstring or `NULL` to omit. 

constchar*constPyStructSequence_UnnamedField[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_UnnamedField "Link to this definition")
    _Part of the[ Stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable) since version 3.11._
Special value for a field name to leave it unnamed.
Changed in version 3.9: The type was changed from `char *`. 

[PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*PyStructSequence_New([PyTypeObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyTypeObject "PyTypeObject")*type)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_New "Link to this definition")
    _Return value: New reference.__Part of the[ Stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable)._
Creates an instance of _type_ , which must have been created with [`PyStructSequence_NewType()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_NewType "PyStructSequence_NewType").
Return `NULL` with an exception set on failure. 

[PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*PyStructSequence_GetItem([PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*p, [Py_ssize_t](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#c.Py_ssize_t "Py_ssize_t")pos)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_GetItem "Link to this definition")
    _Return value: Borrowed reference.__Part of the[ Stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable)._
Return the object at position _pos_ in the struct sequence pointed to by _p_.
Bounds checking is performed as an assertion if Python is built in [debug mode](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build) or [`with assertions`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-assertions). 

[PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*PyStructSequence_GET_ITEM([PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject")*p, [Py_ssize_t](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#c.Py_ssize_t "Py_ssize_t")pos)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_GET_ITEM "Link to this definition")
    _Return value: Borrowed reference._
Alias to [`PyStructSequence_GetItem()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_GetItem "PyStructSequence_GetItem").
Changed in version 3.13: Now implemented as an alias to [`PyStructSequence_GetItem()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyStructSequence_GetItem "PyStructSequence_GetItem").

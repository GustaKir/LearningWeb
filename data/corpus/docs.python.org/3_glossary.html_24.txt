Title: Variable Annotations and Virtual Environments in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
Summary: This document discusses variable annotation syntax and its references, including function annotation and relevant PEPs. It also explains virtual environments, which provide isolated runtime environments for Python applications to manage packages independently.
---

```

Variable annotation syntax is explained in section [Annotated assignment statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#annassign).
See [function annotation](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-function-annotation), [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and [**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/), which describe this functionality. Also see [Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#annotations-howto) for best practices on working with annotations. 

virtual environment[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-environment "Link to this term")
    
A cooperatively isolated runtime environment that allows Python users and applications to install and upgrade Python distribution packages without interfering with the behaviour of other Python applications running on the same system.
See also [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments."). 

virtual machine[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-machine "Link to this term")
    
A computer defined entirely in software. Python’s virtual machine executes the [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) emitted by the bytecode compiler. 

Zen of Python[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-Zen-of-Python "Link to this term")
    
Listing of Python design principles and philosophies that are helpful in understanding and using the language. The listing can be found by typing “`import this`” at the interactive prompt.

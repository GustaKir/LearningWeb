Title: Changelog Updates for Python 3
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section highlights various changes made in Python 3, including making `zipfile._path` a package, adding a `.coveragerc` file for coverage usage, and updates to the test suite execution. Other modifications involve adjusting string tests for the merge of `str` and `unicode` in Python 3 and handling RuntimeWarnings in specific tests.
---

Made `zipfile._path` a package.
  * [gh-106690](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106690): Add .coveragerc to cpython repository for use with coverage package.
  * [gh-101634](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101634): When running the Python test suite with `-jN` option, if a worker stdout cannot be decoded from the locale encoding report a failed testn so the exitcode is non-zero. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-105084](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105084): When the Python build is configured `--with-wheel-pkg-dir`, tests requiring the `setuptools` and `wheel` wheels will search for the wheels in `WHEEL_PKG_DIR`.
  * [gh-81005](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81005): String tests are modified to reflect that `str` and `unicode` are merged in Python 3. Patch by Daniel Fortunov.
  * [gh-103186](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103186): Suppress and assert expected RuntimeWarnings in test_sys_settrace.py
  * [gh-69714](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69714): Add additional tests to [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program.") to achieve full test coverage.


### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id135 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-103053](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103053): “make check-clean-src” now also checks if the “python” program is found in the source directory: fail with an error if it does exist. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-109191](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109191): Fix compile error when building with recent versions of libedit.
  * [gh-110276](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110276): No longer ignore [`PROFILE_TASK`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#envvar-PROFILE_TASK) failure silently: command used by Profile Guided Optimization (PGO). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-109566](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109566): Remove `make testall` target: use `make buildbottest` instead. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-109740](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109740): The experimental `--disable-gil` configure flag now includes “t” (for “threaded”) in extension ABI tags.
  * [gh-109054](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109054): Fix building the `_testcapi` extension on Linux AArch64 which requires linking to libatomic when `<cpython/pyatomic.h>` is used: the `_Py_atomic_or_uint64()` function requires libatomic `__atomic_fetch_or_8()` on this platform. The configure script now checks if linking to libatomic is needed and generates a new LIBATOMIC variable used to build the _testcapi extension. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-63760](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/63760): Fix Solaris build: no longer redefine the `gethostname()` function. Solaris defines the function since 2005. Patch by Victor Stinner, original patch by Jakub Kulík.
  * [gh-108740](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108740): Fix a race condition in `make regen-all`. The `deepfreeze.c` source and files generated by Argument Clinic are now generated or updated before generating “global objects”. Previously, some identifiers may miss depending on the order in which these files were generated. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-108634](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108634): Python built with `configure` [`--with-trace-refs`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-trace-refs) (tracing references) is now ABI compatible with Python release build and [debug build](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-85283](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85283): The `_stat` C extension is now built with the [limited C API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-c-api). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-108447](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108447): Fix x86_64 GNU/Hurd build
  * [gh-107814](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107814): When calling `find_python.bat` with `-q` it did not properly silence the output of nuget. That is now fixed.
  * [gh-105481](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105481): Remove the make target `regen-opcode-targets`, merge its work into `regen-opcode` which repeats most of the calculation. This simplifies the code for the build and reduces code duplication.
  * [gh-106881](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106881): Check for `linux/limits.h` before including it in `Modules/posixmodule.c`.
  * [gh-95855](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95855): Refactor platform triplet detection code and add detection for MIPS soft float and musl libc.
  * [gh-106962](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106962): Detect MPI compilers in `configure`.
  * [gh-106118](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106118): Fix compilation for platforms without `O_CLOEXEC`. The issue was introduced with Py

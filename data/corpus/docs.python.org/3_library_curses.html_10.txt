Title: Curses Library: Window Attribute and Clearing Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html
Summary: This section describes functions for setting character attributes and clearing windows in the curses library. The `window.chgat` function modifies attributes of characters at a specified cursor position, while `window.clear` erases the window and prepares it for repainting during the next refresh. The `window.clearok` function is also mentioned.
---

window.chgat(_y_ , _x_ , _num_ , _attr_)
    
Set the attributes of _num_ characters at the current cursor position, or at position `(y, x)` if supplied. If _num_ is not given or is `-1`, the attribute will be set on all the characters to the end of the line. This function moves cursor to position `(y, x)` if supplied. The changed line will be touched using the [`touchline()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.touchline "curses.window.touchline") method so that the contents will be redisplayed by the next window refresh. 

window.clear()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.clear "Link to this definition")
    
Like [`erase()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.erase "curses.window.erase"), but also cause the whole window to be repainted upon next call to [`refresh()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "curses.window.refresh"). 

window.clearok(_flag_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.clearok "Link to this definition")
    
If _flag_ is `True`, the next call to [`refresh()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "curses.window.refresh") will clear the window completely. 

window.clrtobot()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.clrtobot "Link to this definition")
    
Erase from cursor to the end of the window: all lines below the cursor are deleted, and then the equivalent of [`clrtoeol()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.clrtoeol "curses.window.clrtoeol") is performed. 

window.clrtoeol()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.clrtoeol "Link to this definition")
    
Erase from cursor to the end of the line. 

window.cursyncup()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.cursyncup "Link to this definition")
    
Update the current cursor position of all the ancestors of the window to reflect the current cursor position of the window. 

window.delch([_y_ , _x_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.delch "Link to this definition")
    
Delete any character at `(y, x)`. 

window.deleteln()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.deleteln "Link to this definition")
    
Delete the line under the cursor. All following lines are moved up by one line. 

window.derwin(_begin_y_ , _begin_x_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.derwin "Link to this definition")


window.derwin(_nlines_ , _ncols_ , _begin_y_ , _begin_x_)
    
An abbreviation for “derive window”, [`derwin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.derwin "curses.window.derwin") is the same as calling [`subwin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.subwin "curses.window.subwin"), except that _begin_y_ and _begin_x_ are relative to the origin of the window, rather than relative to the entire screen. Return a window object for the derived window. 

window.echochar(_ch_[, _attr_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.echochar "Link to this definition")
    
Add character _ch_ with attribute _attr_ , and immediately call [`refresh()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.refresh "curses.window.refresh") on the window. 

window.enclose(_y_ , _x_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.enclose "Link to this definition")
    
Test whether the given pair of screen-relative character-cell coordinates are enclosed by the given window, returning `True` or `False`. It is useful for determining what subset of the screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.
Changed in version 3.10: Previously it returned `1` or `0` instead of `True` or `False`. 

window.encoding[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.encoding "Link to this definition")
    
Encoding used to encode method arguments (Unicode strings and characters). The encoding attribute is inherited from the parent window when a subwindow is created, for example with [`window.subwin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.subwin "curses.window.subwin"). By default, current locale encoding is used (see [`locale.getencoding()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getencoding "locale.getencoding")).
Added in version 3.3. 

window.erase()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.erase "Link to this definition")
    
Clear the window. 

window.getbegyx()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.getbegyx "Link to this definition")
    
Return a tuple `(y, x)` of coordinates of upper-left corner. 

window.getbkgd()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.getbkgd "Link to this definition")
    
Return the given window’s current background character/attribute pair.

Title: Socket Functions in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html
Summary: The `socket.sethostname(_name_)` function sets the machine's hostname but raises an `OSError` if permissions are insufficient. It is available on Unix systems since version 3.3. The `socket.if_nameindex()` function returns a list of network interface information as tuples and also raises an `OSError` on failure. It is available on Unix and Windows since version 3.3, with changes in version 3.8.

socket.sethostname(_name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.sethostname "Link to this definition")
    
Set the machine’s hostname to _name_. This will raise an [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if you don’t have enough rights.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `socket.sethostname` with argument `name`.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, not Android.
Added in version 3.3. 

socket.if_nameindex()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.if_nameindex "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list of network interface information (index int, name string) tuples. [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if the system call fails.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, Windows, not WASI.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.8: Windows support was added.
Note
On Windows network interfaces have different names in different contexts (all names are examples):
  * UUID: `{FB605B73-AAC2-49A6-9A2F-25416AEA0573}`
  * name: `ethernet_32770`
  * friendly name: `vEthernet (nat)`
  * description: `Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapter`


This function returns names of the second form from the list, `ethernet_32770` in this example case. 

socket.if_nametoindex(_if_name_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.if_nametoindex "Link to this definition")
    
Return a network interface index number corresponding to an interface name. [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if no interface with the given name exists.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, Windows, not WASI.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.8: Windows support was added.

“Interface name” is a name as documented in [`if_nameindex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.if_nameindex "socket.if_nameindex"). 

socket.if_indextoname(_if_index_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.if_indextoname "Link to this definition")
    
Return a network interface name corresponding to an interface index number. [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if no interface with the given index exists.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, Windows, not WASI.

socket.send_fds(_sock_ , _buffers_ , _fds_[, _flags_[, _address_]])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.send_fds "Link to this definition")
    
Send the list of file descriptors _fds_ over an [`AF_UNIX`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.AF_UNIX "socket.AF_UNIX") socket _sock_. The _fds_ parameter is a sequence of file descriptors. Consult [`sendmsg()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.sendmsg "socket.socket.sendmsg") for the documentation of these parameters.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, Windows, not WASI.
Unix platforms supporting [`sendmsg()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.sendmsg "socket.socket.sendmsg") and `SCM_RIGHTS` mechanism.
Added in version 3.9.

Patch given by Robert Collins, tweaked by Barry Warsaw.
  * [bpo-22226](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22226): First letter no longer is stripped from the “status” key in the result of Treeview.heading().
  * [bpo-19524](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19524): Fixed resource leak in the HTTP connection when an invalid response is received. Patch by Martin Panter.
  * [bpo-20421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20421): Add a .version() method to SSL sockets exposing the actual protocol version in use.
  * [bpo-19546](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19546): configparser exceptions no longer expose implementation details. Chained KeyErrors are removed, which leads to cleaner tracebacks. Patch by Claudiu Popa.
  * [bpo-22051](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22051): turtledemo no longer reloads examples to re-run them. Initialization of variables and gui setup should be done in main(), which is called each time a demo is run, but not on import.
  * [bpo-21933](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21933): Turtledemo users can change the code font size with a menu selection or control(command) ‘-’ or ‘+’ or control-mousewheel. Original patch by Lita Cho.
  * [bpo-21597](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21597): The separator between the turtledemo text pane and the drawing canvas can now be grabbed and dragged with a mouse. The code text pane can be widened to easily view or copy the full width of the text. The canvas can be widened on small screens. Original patches by Jan Kanis and Lita Cho.
  * [bpo-18132](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18132): Turtledemo buttons no longer disappear when the window is shrunk. Original patches by Jan Kanis and Lita Cho.
  * [bpo-22043](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22043): time.monotonic() is now always available. `threading.Lock.acquire()`, `threading.RLock.acquire()` and socket operations now use a monotonic clock, instead of the system clock, when a timeout is used.
  * [bpo-21527](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21527): Add a default number of workers to ThreadPoolExecutor equal to 5 times the number of CPUs. Patch by Claudiu Popa.
  * [bpo-22216](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22216): smtplib now resets its state more completely after a quit. The most obvious consequence of the previous behavior was a STARTTLS failure during a connect/starttls/quit/connect/starttls sequence.
  * [bpo-22098](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22098): ctypes’ BigEndianStructure and LittleEndianStructure now define an empty __slots__ so that subclasses don’t always get an instance dict. Patch by Claudiu Popa.
  * [bpo-22185](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22185): Fix an occasional RuntimeError in threading.Condition.wait() caused by mutation of the waiters queue without holding the lock. Patch by Doug Zongker.
  * [bpo-22287](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22287): On UNIX, _PyTime_gettimeofday() now uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) if available. As a side effect, Python now depends on the librt library on Solaris and on Linux (only with glibc older than 2.17).
  * [bpo-22182](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22182): Use e.args to unpack exceptions correctly in distutils.file_util.move_file. Patch by Claudiu Popa.
  * The webbrowser module now uses subprocess’s start_new_session=True rather than a potentially risky preexec_fn=os.setsid call.
  * [bpo-22042](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22042): signal.set_wakeup_fd(fd) now raises an exception if the file descriptor is in blocking mode.
  * [bpo-16808](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16808): inspect.stack() now returns a named tuple instead of a tuple. Patch by Daniel Shahaf.
  * [bpo-22236](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22236): Fixed Tkinter images copying operations in NoDefaultRoot mode.
  * [bpo-2527](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=2527): Add a _globals_ argument to timeit functions, in order to override the globals namespace in which the timed code is executed. Patch by Ben Roberts.
  * [bpo-22118](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22118): Switch urllib.parse to use RFC 3986 semantics for the resolution of relative URLs, rather than RFCs 1808 and 2396.

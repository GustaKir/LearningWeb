Title: The Python Interpreter and Environment
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html
Summary: This section discusses the need for continuation lines in multi-line constructs in Python, exemplified by an 'if' statement. It also introduces the default source code encoding for Python files, which is UTF-8, allowing the use of a wide range of characters.
---

```

Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement:
>>>```
>>> the_world_is_flat = True
>>> if the_world_is_flat:
...   print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!

```

### 2.2.1. Source Code Encoding[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding "Link to this heading")
By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the _first_ line of the file. The syntax is as follows:
```
# -*- coding: encoding -*-

```

where _encoding_ is one of the valid [`codecs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") supported by Python.
For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:
```
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

```

One exception to the _first line_ rule is when the source code starts with a [UNIX “shebang” line](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#tut-scripts). In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

Title: Cmd Class Methods Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html
Summary: The `do_help()` method in the `Cmd` class allows subclasses to provide help for commands by invoking specific help methods or printing docstrings. When called without an argument, it lists all help topics and undocumented commands. The `onecmd()` method interprets a given string as a command entered at the prompt, which can be overridden if necessary.

Cmd.do_help(_arg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.do_help "Link to this definition")
    
All subclasses of [`Cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd "cmd.Cmd") inherit a predefined `do_help()`. This method, called with an argument `'bar'`, invokes the corresponding method `help_bar()`, and if that is not present, prints the docstring of `do_bar()`, if available. With no argument, `do_help()` lists all available help topics (that is, all commands with corresponding `help_*()` methods or commands that have docstrings), and also lists any undocumented commands. 

Cmd.onecmd(_str_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.onecmd "Link to this definition")
    
Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt. This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be; see the [`precmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.precmd "cmd.Cmd.precmd") and [`postcmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.postcmd "cmd.Cmd.postcmd") methods for useful execution hooks. The return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of commands by the interpreter should stop. If there is a `do_*()` method for the command _str_ , the return value of that method is returned, otherwise the return value from the [`default()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.default "cmd.Cmd.default") method is returned. 

Cmd.emptyline()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.emptyline "Link to this definition")
    
Method called when an empty line is entered in response to the prompt. If this method is not overridden, it repeats the last nonempty command entered. 

Cmd.default(_line_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.default "Link to this definition")
    
Method called on an input line when the command prefix is not recognized. If this method is not overridden, it prints an error message and returns. 

Cmd.completedefault(_text_ , _line_ , _begidx_ , _endidx_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.completedefault "Link to this definition")
    
Method called to complete an input line when no command-specific `complete_*()` method is available. By default, it returns an empty list. 

Cmd.columnize(_list_ , _displaywidth =80_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.columnize "Link to this definition")
    
Method called to display a list of strings as a compact set of columns. Each column is only as wide as necessary. Columns are separated by two spaces for readability. 

Cmd.precmd(_line_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.precmd "Link to this definition")
    
Hook method executed just before the command line _line_ is interpreted, but after the input prompt is generated and issued. This method is a stub in [`Cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd "cmd.Cmd"); it exists to be overridden by subclasses. The return value is used as the command which will be executed by the [`onecmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.onecmd "cmd.Cmd.onecmd") method; the [`precmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.precmd "cmd.Cmd.precmd") implementation may re-write the command or simply return _line_ unchanged. 

Cmd.postcmd(_stop_ , _line_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.postcmd "Link to this definition")
    
Hook method executed just after a command dispatch is finished. This method is a stub in [`Cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd "cmd.Cmd"); it exists to be overridden by subclasses. _line_ is the command line which was executed, and _stop_ is a flag which indicates whether execution will be terminated after the call to [`postcmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.postcmd "cmd.Cmd.postcmd"); this will be the return value of the [`onecmd()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.onecmd "cmd.Cmd.onecmd") method. The return value of this method will be used as the new value for the internal flag which corresponds to _stop_ ; returning false will cause interpretation to continue. 

Cmd.preloop()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.preloop "Link to this definition")
    
Hook method executed once when [`cmdloop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.cmdloop "cmd.Cmd.cmdloop") is called. This method is a stub in [`Cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd "cmd.Cmd"); it exists to be overridden by subclasses.

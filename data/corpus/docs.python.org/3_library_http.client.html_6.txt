Title: HTTPConnection.send Method
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html
Summary: The HTTPConnection.send method transmits data to the server following the endheaders() method and prior to invoking getresponse(). It triggers an auditing event 'http.client.send' with the connection and data as arguments.
---

HTTPConnection.send(_data_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection.send "Link to this definition")
    
Send data to the server. This should be used directly only after the [`endheaders()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection.endheaders "http.client.HTTPConnection.endheaders") method has been called and before [`getresponse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection.getresponse "http.client.HTTPConnection.getresponse") is called.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `http.client.send` with arguments `self`, `data`.
## HTTPResponse Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#httpresponse-objects "Link to this heading")
An [`HTTPResponse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse "http.client.HTTPResponse") instance wraps the HTTP response from the server. It provides access to the request headers and the entity body. The response is an iterable object and can be used in a with statement.
Changed in version 3.5: The [`io.BufferedIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase") interface is now implemented and all of its reader operations are supported. 

HTTPResponse.read([_amt_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.read "Link to this definition")
    
Reads and returns the response body, or up to the next _amt_ bytes. 

HTTPResponse.readinto(_b_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.readinto "Link to this definition")
    
Reads up to the next len(b) bytes of the response body into the buffer _b_. Returns the number of bytes read.
Added in version 3.3. 

HTTPResponse.getheader(_name_ , _default =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.getheader "Link to this definition")
    
Return the value of the header _name_ , or _default_ if there is no header matching _name_. If there is more than one header with the name _name_ , return all of the values joined by ‘, ‘. If _default_ is any iterable other than a single string, its elements are similarly returned joined by commas. 

HTTPResponse.getheaders()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.getheaders "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list of (header, value) tuples. 

HTTPResponse.fileno()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.fileno "Link to this definition")
    
Return the `fileno` of the underlying socket. 

HTTPResponse.msg[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.msg "Link to this definition")
    
A [`http.client.HTTPMessage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPMessage "http.client.HTTPMessage") instance containing the response headers. [`http.client.HTTPMessage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPMessage "http.client.HTTPMessage") is a subclass of [`email.message.Message`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.compat32-message.html#email.message.Message "email.message.Message"). 

HTTPResponse.version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.version "Link to this definition")
    
HTTP protocol version used by server. 10 for HTTP/1.0, 11 for HTTP/1.1. 

HTTPResponse.url[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.url "Link to this definition")
    
URL of the resource retrieved, commonly used to determine if a redirect was followed. 

HTTPResponse.headers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.headers "Link to this definition")
    
Headers of the response in the form of an [`email.message.EmailMessage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.message.html#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage") instance. 

HTTPResponse.status[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.status "Link to this definition")
    
Status code returned by server. 

HTTPResponse.reason[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.reason "Link to this definition")
    
Reason phrase returned by server. 

HTTPResponse.debuglevel[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.debuglevel "Link to this definition")
    
A debugging hook. If [`debuglevel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.debuglevel "http.client.HTTPResponse.debuglevel") is greater than zero, messages will be printed to stdout as the response is read and parsed. 

HTTPResponse.closed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPResponse.closed "Link to this definition")
    
Is `True` if the stream is closed.

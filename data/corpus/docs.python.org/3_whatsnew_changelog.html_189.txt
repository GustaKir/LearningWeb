_Release date: 2023-03-07_
### Security[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id160 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-99108](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99108): Replace builtin hashlib implementations of MD5 and SHA1 with verified ones from the HACL* project.
  * [gh-101727](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101727): Updated the OpenSSL version used in Windows and macOS binary release builds to 1.1.1t to address [**CVE 2023-0286**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0286), [**CVE 2022-4303**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4303), and [**CVE 2022-4303**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4303) per [the OpenSSL 2023-02-07 security advisory](https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).
  * [gh-99108](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99108): Replace the builtin [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.") implementations of SHA2-384 and SHA2-512 originally from LibTomCrypt with formally verified, side-channel resistant code from the [HACL*](https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star/) project. The builtins remain a fallback only used when OpenSSL does not provide them.
  * [gh-101283](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101283): [`subprocess.Popen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen "subprocess.Popen") now uses a safer approach to find `cmd.exe` when launching with `shell=True`. Patch by Eryk Sun, based on a patch by Oleg Iarygin.

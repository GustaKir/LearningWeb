### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id184 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-45256](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45256): Fix a bug that caused an [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") to be raised in `python-gdb.py` when `py-locals` is used without a frame.
  * [gh-100342](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100342): Add missing `NULL` check for possible allocation failure in `*args` parsing in Argument Clinic.


### C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id185 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-99947](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99947): Raising SystemError on import will now have its cause be set to the original unexpected exception.
  * [gh-99240](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99240): In argument parsing, after deallocating newly allocated memory, reset its pointer to NULL.
  * [gh-98724](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98724): The [`Py_CLEAR`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_CLEAR "Py_CLEAR"), [`Py_SETREF`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_SETREF "Py_SETREF") and [`Py_XSETREF`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_XSETREF "Py_XSETREF") macros now only evaluate their arguments once. If an argument has side effects, these side effects are no longer duplicated. Patch by Victor Stinner.


## Python 3.12.0 alpha 3[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-0-alpha-3 "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2022-12-06_
### Security[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id186 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-100001](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100001): `python -m http.server` no longer allows terminal control characters sent within a garbage request to be printed to the stderr server log.
This is done by changing the [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers.") `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` `.log_message` method to replace control characters with a `\x_HH_`hex escape before printing.
  * [gh-87604](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87604): Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter audit hooks via the [`gc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#module-gc "gc: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector.") module

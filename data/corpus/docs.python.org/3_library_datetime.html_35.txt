Title: Equality Comparisons and Ambiguities in Datetime Instances
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
Summary: Datetime instances differing only by the 'fold' attribute are considered equal in comparisons. Applications should check the 'fold' value to avoid wall-time ambiguities or refrain from using hybrid tzinfo subclasses. Using timezone or fixed-offset tzinfo subclasses eliminates ambiguities.

```

Note that the [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances that differ only by the value of the [`fold`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute are considered equal in comparisons.
Applications that can’t bear wall-time ambiguities should explicitly check the value of the [`fold`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fold "datetime.datetime.fold") attribute or avoid using hybrid [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclasses; there are no ambiguities when using [`timezone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone"), or any other fixed-offset [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo") subclass (such as a class representing only EST (fixed offset -5 hours), or only EDT (fixed offset -4 hours)).

[`zoneinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html#module-zoneinfo "zoneinfo: IANA time zone support")
    
> The `datetime` module has a basic [`timezone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") class (for handling arbitrary fixed offsets from UTC) and its [`timezone.utc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone.utc "datetime.timezone.utc") attribute (a UTC `timezone` instance).
> `zoneinfo` brings the _IANA time zone database_ (also known as the Olson database) to Python, and its usage is recommended. 

[IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)
    
The Time Zone Database (often called tz, tzdata or zoneinfo) contains code and data that represent the history of local time for many representative locations around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight-saving rules.
## [`timezone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timezone-objects "Link to this heading")
The [`timezone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") class is a subclass of [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.tzinfo "datetime.tzinfo"), each instance of which represents a time zone defined by a fixed offset from UTC.
Objects of this class cannot be used to represent time zone information in the locations where different offsets are used in different days of the year or where historical changes have been made to civil time. 

_class_ datetime.timezone(_offset_ , _name =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "Link to this definition")
    
The _offset_ argument must be specified as a [`timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") object representing the difference between the local time and UTC. It must be strictly between `-timedelta(hours=24)` and `timedelta(hours=24)`, otherwise [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.
The _name_ argument is optional. If specified it must be a string that will be used as the value returned by the [`datetime.tzname()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.tzname "datetime.datetime.tzname") method.
Added in version 3.2.
Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes. 

timezone.utcoffset(_dt_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone.utcoffset "Link to this definition")
    
Return the fixed value specified when the [`timezone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") instance is constructed.
The _dt_ argument is ignored. The return value is a [`timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") instance equal to the difference between the local time and UTC.
Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.

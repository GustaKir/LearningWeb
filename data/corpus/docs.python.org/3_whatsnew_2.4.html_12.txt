Title: New Encodings and Collections Module in Python 2.4
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.4.html
Summary: Python 2.4 introduces several new character encodings including various Japanese and Korean encodings, as well as HP Roman8 and others. The UTF-8 and UTF-16 codecs have been improved to handle partial input more effectively. Additionally, a new 'collections' module is introduced, featuring the 'deque' type for efficient double-ended queue operations.

Japanese: cp932, euc-jis-2004, euc-jp, euc-jisx0213, iso-2022-jp,
    
iso-2022-jp-1, iso-2022-jp-2, iso-2022-jp-3, iso-2022-jp-ext, iso-2022-jp-2004, shift-jis, shift-jisx0213, shift-jis-2004
  * Korean: cp949, euc-kr, johab, iso-2022-kr
  * Some other new encodings were added: HP Roman8, ISO_8859-11, ISO_8859-16, PCTP-154, and TIS-620.
  * The UTF-8 and UTF-16 codecs now cope better with receiving partial input. Previously the `StreamReader` class would try to read more data, making it impossible to resume decoding from the stream. The `read()` method will now return as much data as it can and future calls will resume decoding where previous ones left off. (Implemented by Walter DÃ¶rwald.)
  * There is a new [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") module for various specialized collection datatypes. Currently it contains just one type, `deque`, a double-ended queue that supports efficiently adding and removing elements from either end:
>>>```
>>> fromcollectionsimport deque
>>> d = deque('ghi')    # make a new deque with three items
>>> d.append('j')      # add a new entry to the right side
>>> d.appendleft('f')    # add a new entry to the left side
>>> d            # show the representation of the deque
deque(['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'])
>>> d.pop()         # return and remove the rightmost item
'j'
>>> d.popleft()       # return and remove the leftmost item
'f'
>>> list(d)         # list the contents of the deque
['g', 'h', 'i']
>>> 'h' in d        # search the deque
True

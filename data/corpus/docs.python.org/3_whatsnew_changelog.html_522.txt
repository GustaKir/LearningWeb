Title: Python Compiler Enhancements in Changelog
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: The Python compiler now includes explicit instructions for stack adjustments and cleanup for control statements like break, continue, and return. Several opcodes have been removed and added, and changes to `END_FINALLY` and `WITH_CLEANUP_START` behavior have been made. New features include `unicodedata.is_normalized` for string normalization checks and a restriction on yield expressions in comprehensions.
---

The compiler emits now explicit instructions for adjusting the stack of values and calling the cleaning up code for [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) and [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return).
Removed opcodes `BREAK_LOOP`, `CONTINUE_LOOP`, `SETUP_LOOP` and `SETUP_EXCEPT`. Added new opcodes `ROT_FOUR`, `BEGIN_FINALLY` and `CALL_FINALLY` and `POP_FINALLY`. Changed the behavior of `END_FINALLY` and `WITH_CLEANUP_START`.
  * [bpo-32285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32285): New function unicodedata.is_normalized, which can check whether a string is in a specific normal form.
  * [bpo-10544](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10544): Yield expressions are now disallowed in comprehensions and generator expressions except the expression for the outermost iterable.
  * [bpo-32117](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32117): Iterable unpacking is now allowed without parentheses in yield and return statements, e.g. `yield 1, 2, 3, *rest`. Thanks to David Cuthbert for the change and Jordan Chapman for added tests.
  * [bpo-31902](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31902): Fix the `col_offset` attribute for ast nodes `ast.AsyncFor`, `ast.AsyncFunctionDef`, and `ast.AsyncWith`. Previously, `col_offset` pointed to the keyword after `async`.
  * [bpo-25862](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25862): Fix assertion failures in the `tell()` method of `io.TextIOWrapper`. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * [bpo-21983](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21983): Fix a crash in `ctypes.cast()` in case the type argument is a ctypes structured data type. Patch by Eryk Sun and Oren Milman.
  * [bpo-31577](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31577): Fix a crash in `os.utime()` in case of a bad ns argument. Patch by Oren Milman.
  * [bpo-29832](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29832): Remove references to ‘getsockaddrarg’ from various socket error messages. Patch by Oren Milman.

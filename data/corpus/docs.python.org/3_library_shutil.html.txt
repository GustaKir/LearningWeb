# `shutil` — High-level file operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/shutil.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/shutil.py)
The [`shutil`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying.") module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal. For operations on individual files, see also the [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") module.
Warning
Even the higher-level file copying functions ([`shutil.copy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy "shutil.copy"), [`shutil.copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2")) cannot copy all file metadata.
On POSIX platforms, this means that file owner and group are lost as well as ACLs. On Mac OS, the resource fork and other metadata are not used. This means that resources will be lost and file type and creator codes will not be correct. On Windows, file owners, ACLs and alternate data streams are not copied.
## Directory and files operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#directory-and-files-operations "Link to this heading")

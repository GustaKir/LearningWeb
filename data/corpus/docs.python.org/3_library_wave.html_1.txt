Title: Wave_read Class in Python's wave Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html
Summary: The wave.Wave_read class facilitates reading WAV files in Python. It provides methods to close the stream, get the number of audio channels, sample width, and frame rate. Instances of Wave_read are initiated using the open() function and include automatic resource management.

_class_ wave.Wave_read[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read "Link to this definition")
    
Read a WAV file.
Wave_read objects, as returned by [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.open "wave.open"), have the following methods: 

close()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.close "Link to this definition")
    
Close the stream if it was opened by [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."), and make the instance unusable. This is called automatically on object collection. 

getnchannels()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getnchannels "Link to this definition")
    
Returns number of audio channels (`1` for mono, `2` for stereo). 

getsampwidth()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getsampwidth "Link to this definition")
    
Returns sample width in bytes. 

getframerate()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getframerate "Link to this definition")
    
Returns sampling frequency. 

getnframes()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getnframes "Link to this definition")
    
Returns number of audio frames. 

getcomptype()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getcomptype "Link to this definition")
    
Returns compression type (`'NONE'` is the only supported type). 

getcompname()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getcompname "Link to this definition")
    
Human-readable version of [`getcomptype()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getcomptype "wave.Wave_read.getcomptype"). Usually `'not compressed'` parallels `'NONE'`. 

getparams()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getparams "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a [`namedtuple()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple") `(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype, compname)`, equivalent to output of the `get*()` methods. 

readframes(_n_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.readframes "Link to this definition")
    
Reads and returns at most _n_ frames of audio, as a [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object. 

rewind()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.rewind "Link to this definition")
    
Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream.
The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the old `aifc` module, and don’t do anything interesting. 

getmarkers()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmarkers "Link to this definition")
    
Returns `None`.
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: The method only existed for compatibility with the `aifc` module which has been removed in Python 3.13. 

getmark(_id_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmark "Link to this definition")
    
Raise an error.
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: The method only existed for compatibility with the `aifc` module which has been removed in Python 3.13.
The following two methods define a term “position” which is compatible between them, and is otherwise implementation dependent. 

setpos(_pos_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.setpos "Link to this definition")
    
Set the file pointer to the specified position. 

tell()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.tell "Link to this definition")
    
Return current file pointer position.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.13, compared to 3.12. Python 3.13 was released on October 7, 2024. For full details, see the [changelog](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#changelog).

## Summary – Release Highlights[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#summary-release-highlights "Link to this heading")
Python 3.13 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation and the standard library. The biggest changes include a new [interactive interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-better-interactive-interpreter), experimental support for running in a [free-threaded mode](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython) ([**PEP 703**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)), and a [Just-In-Time compiler](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-jit-compiler) ([**PEP 744**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/)).
Error messages continue to improve, with tracebacks now highlighted in color by default. The [`locals()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals "locals") builtin now has [defined semantics](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-locals-semantics) for changing the returned mapping, and type parameters now support default values.
The library changes contain removal of deprecated APIs and modules, as well as the usual improvements in user-friendliness and correctness. Several legacy standard library modules have now [been removed](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-pep594) following their deprecation in Python 3.11 ([**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/)).
This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of all new features, but instead gives a convenient overview. For full details refer to the documentation, such as the [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index) and [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index). To understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully implemented. See [Porting to Python 3.13](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#porting-to-python-3-13) for guidance on upgrading from earlier versions of Python.
Interpreter improvements:
  * A greatly improved [interactive interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-better-interactive-interpreter) and [improved error messages](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-improved-error-messages).
  * [**PEP 667**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/): The [`locals()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals "locals") builtin now has [defined semantics](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-locals-semantics) when mutating the returned mapping. Python debuggers and similar tools may now more reliably update local variables in optimized scopes even during concurrent code execution.
  * [**PEP 703**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/): CPython 3.13 has experimental support for running with the [global interpreter lock](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock) disabled. See [Free-threaded CPython](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython) for more details.
  * [**PEP 744**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/): A basic [JIT compiler](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-jit-compiler) was added. It is currently disabled by default (though we may turn it on later). Performance improv

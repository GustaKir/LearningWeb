Title: Tkinter Module Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
Summary: This section covers various components of the Tkinter library, including color, file, and font dialogs. It highlights the `colorchooser` for selecting colors, the `commondialog` as a base class for dialogs, `filedialog` for file selection, and utilities for working with fonts.
---

[`tkinter.colorchooser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.colorchooser.html#module-tkinter.colorchooser "tkinter.colorchooser: Color choosing dialog \(Tk\)")
    
Dialog to let the user choose a color. 

[`tkinter.commondialog`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dialog.html#module-tkinter.commondialog "tkinter.commondialog: Tkinter base class for dialogs \(Tk\)")
    
Base class for the dialogs defined in the other modules listed here. 

[`tkinter.filedialog`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dialog.html#module-tkinter.filedialog "tkinter.filedialog: Dialog classes for file selection \(Tk\)")
    
Common dialogs to allow the user to specify a file to open or save. 

[`tkinter.font`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.font.html#module-tkinter.font "tkinter.font: Tkinter font-wrapping class \(Tk\)")
    
Utilities to help work with fonts. 

[`tkinter.messagebox`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.messagebox.html#module-tkinter.messagebox "tkinter.messagebox: Various types of alert dialogs \(Tk\)")
    
Access to standard Tk dialog boxes. 

[`tkinter.scrolledtext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.scrolledtext.html#module-tkinter.scrolledtext "tkinter.scrolledtext: Text widget with a vertical scroll bar. \(Tk\)")
    
Text widget with a vertical scroll bar built in. 

[`tkinter.simpledialog`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dialog.html#module-tkinter.simpledialog "tkinter.simpledialog: Simple dialog windows \(Tk\)")
    
Basic dialogs and convenience functions. 

[`tkinter.ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set")
    
Themed widget set introduced in Tk 8.5, providing modern alternatives for many of the classic widgets in the main [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module.
Additional modules: 

[`_tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-_tkinter "_tkinter: A binary module that contains the low-level interface to Tcl/Tk.")
    
A binary module that contains the low-level interface to Tcl/Tk. It is automatically imported by the main [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module, and should never be used directly by application programmers. It is usually a shared library (or DLL), but might in some cases be statically linked with the Python interpreter. 

[`idlelib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#module-idlelib "idlelib: Implementation package for the IDLE shell/editor.")
    
Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE). Based on [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"). 

`tkinter.constants`
    
Symbolic constants that can be used in place of strings when passing various parameters to Tkinter calls. Automatically imported by the main [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module. 

[`tkinter.dnd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.dnd.html#module-tkinter.dnd "tkinter.dnd: Tkinter drag-and-drop interface \(Tk\)")
    
(experimental) Drag-and-drop support for [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"). This will become deprecated when it is replaced with the Tk DND. 

[`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle "turtle: An educational framework for simple graphics applications")
    
Turtle graphics in a Tk window.
## Tkinter Life Preserver[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#tkinter-life-preserver "Link to this heading")
This section is not designed to be an exhaustive tutorial on either Tk or Tkinter. For that, refer to one of the external resources noted earlier. Instead, this section provides a very quick orientation to what a Tkinter application looks like, identifies foundational Tk concepts, and explains how the Tkinter wrapper is structured.
The remainder of this section will help you to identify the classes, methods, and options you’ll need in your Tkinter application, and where to find more detailed documentation on them, including in the official Tcl/Tk reference manual.
### A Hello World Program[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#a-hello-world-program "Link to this heading")
We’ll start by walking through a “Hello World” application in Tkinter. This isn’t the smallest one we could write, but has enough to illustrate some key concepts you’ll need to know.

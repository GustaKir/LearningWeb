Title: Python 3.11 - New Features and Improvements
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html
Summary: Python 3.11 introduces a `-P` command line option and a `PYTHONSAFEPATH` environment variable to prevent automatic directory prepending to `sys.path`, ensuring only standard library and installed modules are imported to avoid module shadowing. Additionally, a new 'z' option has been added to the Format Specification Mini-Language.

* Added a [`-P`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-P) command line option and a [`PYTHONSAFEPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSAFEPATH) environment variable, which disable the automatic prepending to [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path") of the scriptâ€™s directory when running a script, or the current directory when using [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) and [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m). This ensures only stdlib and installed modules are picked up by [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import), and avoids unintentionally or maliciously shadowing modules with those in a local (and typically user-writable) directory.

  * A `"z"` option was added to the [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) that coerces negative to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. See [**PEP 682**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0682/) for more details. (Contributed by John Belmonte in [gh-90153](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90153).)
  * Bytes are no longer accepted on [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "sys.path"). Support broke sometime between Python 3.2 and 3.6, with no one noticing until after Python 3.10.0 was released. In addition, bringing back support would be problematic due to interactions between [`-b`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-b) and [`sys.path_importer_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path_importer_cache "sys.path_importer_cache") when there is a mixture of [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") and [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") keys.

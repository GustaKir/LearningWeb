# 3. Configure Python[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#configure-python "Link to this heading")
## 3.1. Build Requirements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#build-requirements "Link to this heading")
Features and minimum versions required to build CPython:
  * A [C11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/11) compiler. [Optional C11 features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_\(C_standard_revision\)#Optional_features) are not required.
  * On Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later is required.
  * Support for [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point numbers and [floating-point Not-a-Number (NaN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN#Floating_point).
  * Support for threads.
  * OpenSSL 1.1.1 is the minimum version and OpenSSL 3.0.9 is the recommended minimum version for the [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") and [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.") extension modules.
  * SQLite 3.15.2 for the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") extension module.
  * Tcl/Tk 8.5.12 for the [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module.
  * Autoconf 2.71 and aclocal 1.16.5 are required to regenerate the `configure` script.


Changed in version 3.1: Tcl/Tk version 8.3.1 is now required.
Changed in version 3.5: On Windows, Visual Studio 2015 or later is now required. Tcl/Tk version 8.4 is now required.
Changed in version 3.6: Selected C99 features are now required, like `<stdint.h>` and `static inline` functions.
Changed in version 3.7: Thread support and OpenSSL 1.0.2 are now required.
Changed in version 3.10: OpenSSL 1.1.1 is now required. Require SQLite 3.7.15.
Changed in version 3.11: C11 compiler, IEEE 754 and NaN support are now required. On Windows, Visual Studio 2017 or later is required. Tcl/Tk version 8.5.12 is now required for the [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module.
Changed in version 3.13: Autoconf 2.71, aclocal 1.16.5 and SQLite 3.15.2 are now required.
See also [**PEP 7**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/) “Style Guide for C Code” and [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) “CPython platform support”.
## 3.2. Generated files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#generated-files "Link to this heading")
To reduce build dependencies, Python source code contains multiple generated files. Commands to regenerate all generated files:
```
makeregen-all
makeregen-stdlib-module-names
makeregen-limited-abi
makeregen-configure

```

The `Makefile.pre.in` file documents generated files, their inputs, and tools used to regenerate them. Search for `regen-*` make targets.
### 3.2.1. configure script[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#configure-script "Link to this heading")
The `make regen-configure` command regenerates the `aclocal.m4` file and the `configure` script using the `Tools/build/regen-configure.sh` shell script which uses an Ubuntu container to get the same tools versions and have a reproducible output.
The container is optional, the following command can be run locally:
```
autoreconf-ivf-Werror

```

The generated files can change depending on the exact `autoconf-archive`, `aclocal` and `pkg-config` versions.
## 3.3. Configure Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#configure-options "Link to this heading")
List all `configure` script options using:
```
./configure--help

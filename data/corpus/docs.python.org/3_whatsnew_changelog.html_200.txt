Title: Performance Improvements in Python 3.XX
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This chunk outlines several enhancements in the Python 3.x series, including the default settings for statistics collection, improvements to the `BUILD_LIST` opcode, specialization of `FOR_ITER` for tuples, better error handling in the tokenizer, and optimizations for the `hasattr()` function.
---

ection is now off by default. To enable it early at startup, pass the `-Xpystats` flag. Stats are now always dumped, even if switched off.
  * [gh-100146](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100146): Improve `BUILD_LIST` opcode so that it works similarly to the `BUILD_TUPLE` opcode, by stealing references from the stack rather than repeatedly using stack operations to set list elements. Implementation details are in a new private API `_PyList_FromArraySteal()`.
  * [gh-100110](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100110): Specialize `FOR_ITER` for tuples.
  * [gh-100050](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100050): Honor existing errors obtained when searching for mismatching parentheses in the tokenizer. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  * [gh-92216](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92216): Improve the performance of [`hasattr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hasattr "hasattr") for type objects with a missing attribute.
  * [gh-99582](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99582): Freeze [`zipimport`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives.") module into `_bootstrap_python`.
  * [gh-99554](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99554): Pack debugging location tables more efficiently during bytecode compilation.
  * [gh-98522](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98522): Add an internal version number to code objects, to give better versioning of inner functions and comprehensions, and thus better specialization of those functions. This change is invisible to both Python and C extensions.
  * [gh-94603](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94603): Improve performance of `list.pop` for small lists.
  * [gh-89051](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89051): Add [`ssl.OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT "ssl.OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT")
  * [bpo-32782](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32782): `ctypes` arrays of length 0 now report a correct itemsize when a `memoryview` is constructed from them, rather than always giving a value of 0.

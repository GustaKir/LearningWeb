Title: Text Colors in IDLE
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html
Summary: IDLE uses default black on white text but highlights special meanings for different types of text, including shell outputs, errors, keywords, and comments. Additionally, it highlights soft keywords in pattern-matching statements, although this highlighting may not always be accurate.

### Text colors[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#text-colors "Link to this heading")
Idle defaults to black on white text, but colors text with special meanings. For the shell, these are shell output, shell error, user output, and user error. For Python code, at the shell prompt or in an editor, these are keywords, builtin class and function names, names following `class` and `def`, strings, and comments. For any text window, these are the cursor (when present), found text (when possible), and selected text.
IDLE also highlights the [soft keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords) [`match`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match), [`case`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#match), and [`_`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#wildcard-patterns) in pattern-matching statements. However, this highlighting is not perfect and will be incorrect in some rare cases, including some `_`-s in `case` patterns.
Text coloring is done in the background, so uncolorized text is occasionally visible. To change the color scheme, use the Configure IDLE dialog Highlighting tab. The marking of debugger breakpoint lines in the editor and text in popups and dialogs is not user-configurable.
## Startup and Code Execution[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#startup-and-code-execution "Link to this heading")
Upon startup with the `-s` option, IDLE will execute the file referenced by the environment variables `IDLESTARTUP` or [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP). IDLE first checks for `IDLESTARTUP`; if `IDLESTARTUP` is present the file referenced is run. If `IDLESTARTUP` is not present, IDLE checks for `PYTHONSTARTUP`. Files referenced by these environment variables are convenient places to store functions that are used frequently from the IDLE shell, or for executing import statements to import common modules.
In addition, `Tk` also loads a startup file if it is present. Note that the Tk file is loaded unconditionally. This additional file is `.Idle.py` and is looked for in the user’s home directory. Statements in this file will be executed in the Tk namespace, so this file is not useful for importing functions to be used from IDLE’s Python shell.
### Command line usage[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#command-line-usage "Link to this heading")
IDLE can be invoked from the command line with various options. The general syntax is:

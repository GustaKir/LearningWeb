Title: New Features in Python 2.7
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html
Summary: This document outlines the enhancements introduced in Python 2.7, released on July 3, 2010. Key improvements include better numeric handling for both floating-point and Decimal types, along with significant updates to the standard library. Notable additions are an enhanced unittest module, the argparse module for command-line parsing, and new classes such as OrderedDict and Counter in the collections module.

This article explains the new features in Python 2.7. Python 2.7 was released on July 3, 2010.
Numeric handling has been improved in many ways, for both floating-point numbers and for the [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") class. There are some useful additions to the standard library, such as a greatly enhanced [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") module, the [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library.") module for parsing command-line options, convenient [`OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict "collections.OrderedDict") and [`Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter "collections.Counter") classes in the [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") module, and many other improvements.
Python 2.7 is planned to be the last of the 2.x releases, so we worked on making it a good release for the long term. To help with porting to Python 3, several new features from the Python 3.x series have been included in 2.7.
This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview. For full details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.7 at <https://docs.python.org>. If you want to understand the rationale for the design and implementation, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature or the issue on <https://bugs.python.org> in which a change was discussed. Whenever possible, “What’s New in Python” links to the bug/patch item for each change.
## The Future for Python 2.x[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#the-future-for-python-2-x "Link to this heading")
Python 2.7 is the last major release in the 2.x series, as the Python maintainers have shifted the focus of their new feature development efforts to the Python 3.x series. This means that while Python 2 continues to receive bug fixes, and to be updated to build correctly on new hardware and versions of supported operated systems, there will be no new full feature releases for the language or standard library.
However, while there is a large common subset between Python 2.7 and Python 3, and many of the changes involved in migrating to that common subset, or directly to Python 3, can be safely automated, some other changes (notably those associated with Unicode handling) may require careful consideration, and preferably robust automated regression test suites, to migrate effectively.
This means that Python 2.7 will remain in place for a long time, providing a stable and supported base platform for production systems that have not yet been ported to Python 3. The full expected lifecycle of the Python 2.7 series is detailed in [**PEP 373**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0373/).
Some key consequences of the long-term significance of 2.7 are:
  * As noted above, the 2.7 release has a much longer period of maintenance when compared to earlier 2.x versions. Python 2.7 is currently expected to remain supported by the core development team (receiving security updates and other bug fixes) until at least 2020 (10 years after its initial release, compared to the more typical support period of 18–24 months).
  * As the Python 2.7 standard library ages, making effective use of the Python Package Index (either directly or via a redistributor) becomes more important for Python 2 users. In addition to a wide variety of third party packages for various tasks, the available packages include backports of new modules and features from the Python 3 standard library that are compatible with Python 2, as well as various tools and libraries that can make it easier to migrate to Python 3. The [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org) provides guidance on downloading and installing software from the Python Package Index.
  * While the preferred approach to enhancing Python 2 is now the publication of new packages on the Python Package Index, this approach doesn’t necessarily work in all cases, especially those related to network security. In exceptional cases that cannot be handled adequately by publishing new or updated packages on PyPI, the Python Enhancement Proposal process may be used to make the case for adding new features directly to the Python 2 standard library. Any such additions, and the maintenance releases where they were added, will be noted in the [New Features Added to Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#py27-maintenance-enhancements) section below.

Title: PyVarObject Structure in Python C API
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html
Summary: The `PyVarObject` is an extension of `PyObject`, adding the `ob_size` field for objects that have a notion of length. It is not commonly used in the Python/C API, and access to its members is facilitated through specific macros like `Py_REFCNT`, `Py_TYPE`, and `Py_SIZE`.

typePyVarObject[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject "Link to this definition")
    _Part of the[ Limited API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable). (Only some members are part of the stable ABI.)_
This is an extension of [`PyObject`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") that adds the [`ob_size`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyVarObject.ob_size "PyVarObject.ob_size") field. This is only used for objects that have some notion of _length_. This type does not often appear in the Python/C API. Access to the members must be done by using the macros [`Py_REFCNT`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT"), [`Py_TYPE`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.Py_TYPE "Py_TYPE"), and [`Py_SIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.Py_SIZE "Py_SIZE"). 

PyObject_HEAD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_HEAD "Link to this definition")
    
This is a macro used when declaring new types which represent objects without a varying length. The PyObject_HEAD macro expands to:
```
PyObjectob_base;

```

See documentation of [`PyObject`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") above. 

PyObject_VAR_HEAD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_VAR_HEAD "Link to this definition")
    
This is a macro used when declaring new types which represent objects with a length that varies from instance to instance. The PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro expands to:
```
PyVarObjectob_base;

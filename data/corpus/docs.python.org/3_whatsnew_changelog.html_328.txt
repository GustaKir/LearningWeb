Title: Python Changelog: Socket and `bdist_msi` Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This chunk addresses several updates in Python, including changes related to the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option in UDP. The `bdist_msi` command has been removed, which was deprecated in Python 3.9, with a recommendation to use `bdist_wheel` instead. Additionally, modifications have been made to `unittest.TestResult` methods such as `addFailure()`, `addError()`, `addSkip()`, and `addSubTest()`.
---

This is because of the behavior of the socket option `SO_REUSEADDR` in UDP.
Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
  * [bpo-45124](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45124): The `bdist_msi` command, deprecated in Python 3.9, is now removed.
Use `bdist_wheel` (wheel packages) instead.
Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
  * [bpo-30856](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30856): [`unittest.TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") methods [`addFailure()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.addFailure "unittest.TestResult.addFailure"), [`addError()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.addError "unittest.TestResult.addError"), [`addSkip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.addSkip "unittest.TestResult.addSkip") and [`addSubTest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.addSubTest "unittest.TestResult.addSubTest") are now called immediately after raising an exception in test or finishing a subtest. Previously they were called only after finishing the test clean up.
  * [bpo-45034](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45034): Changes how error is formatted for `struct.pack` with `'H'` and `'h'` modes and too large / small numbers. Now it shows the actual numeric limits, while previously it was showing arithmetic expressions.
  * [bpo-25894](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25894): [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") now always reports skipped and failed subtests separately: separate characters in default mode and separate lines in verbose mode. Also the test description is now output for errors in test method, class and module cleanups.
  * [bpo-45081](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45081): Fix issue when dataclasses that inherit from `typing.Protocol` subclasses have wrong `__init__`. Patch provided by Yurii Karabas.
  * [bpo-45085](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45085): The `binhex` module, deprecated in Python 3.9, is now removed. The following [`binascii`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html#module-binascii "binascii: Tools for converting between binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations.") functions, deprecated in Python 3.9, are now also removed:
    * `a2b_hqx()`, `b2a_hqx()`;
    * `rlecode_hqx()`, `rledecode_hqx()`.
The [`binascii.crc_hqx()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html#binascii.crc_hqx "binascii.crc_hqx") function remains available.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-40360](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40360): The `lib2to3` package is now deprecated and may not be able to parse Python 3.10 or newer. See the [**PEP 617**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/) (New PEG parser for CPython). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-45075](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45075): Rename `traceback.StackSummary.format_frame()` to [`traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary "traceback.StackSummary.format_frame_summary"). This method was added for 3.11 so it was not released yet.
Updated code and docs to better distinguish frame and FrameSummary.
  * [bpo-31299](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31299): Add option to completely drop frames from a traceback by returning `None` from a `format_frame()` override.
  * [bpo-41620](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=41620): [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.run "unittest.TestCase.run") now always return a [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") instance.

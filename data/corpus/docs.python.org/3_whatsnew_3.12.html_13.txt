Title: Python 3.12 Release Highlights
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html
Summary: This chunk outlines key updates in Python 3.12 including new support for detecting Windows 11 and newer Windows Server releases, the introduction of convenience variables in the debugger (pdb) for easier access to temporary values during debug sessions, and the addition of the `random.binomialvariate()` function in the random module.

### platform[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#platform "Link to this heading")
  * Add support for detecting Windows 11 and Windows Server releases past 2012. Previously, lookups on Windows Server platforms newer than Windows Server 2012 and on Windows 11 would return `Windows-10`. (Contributed by Steve Dower in [gh-89545](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89545).)


### pdb[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#pdb "Link to this heading")
  * Add convenience variables to hold values temporarily for debug session and provide quick access to values like the current frame or the return value. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-103693](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103693).)


### random[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#random "Link to this heading")
  * Add [`random.binomialvariate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.binomialvariate "random.binomialvariate"). (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in [gh-81620](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81620).)
  * Add a default of `lambd=1.0` to [`random.expovariate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.expovariate "random.expovariate"). (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in [gh-100234](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100234).)


### shutil[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#shutil "Link to this heading")
  * [`shutil.make_archive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.make_archive "shutil.make_archive") now passes the _root_dir_ argument to custom archivers which support it. In this case it no longer temporarily changes the current working directory of the process to _root_dir_ to perform archiving. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-74696](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74696).)
  * [`shutil.rmtree()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree "shutil.rmtree") now accepts a new argument _onexc_ which is an error handler like _onerror_ but which expects an exception instance rather than a _(typ, val, tb)_ triplet. _onerror_ is deprecated. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-102828](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102828).)
  * [`shutil.which()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which "shutil.which") now consults the _PATHEXT_ environment variable to find matches within _PATH_ on Windows even when the given _cmd_ includes a directory component. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-103179](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103179).)
[`shutil.which()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which "shutil.which") will call `NeedCurrentDirectoryForExePathW` when querying for executables on Windows to determine if the current working directory should be prepended to the search path. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-103179](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103179).)
[`shutil.which()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which "shutil.which") will return a path matching the _cmd_ with a component from `PATHEXT` prior to a direct match elsewhere in the search path on Windows. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-103179](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103179).)

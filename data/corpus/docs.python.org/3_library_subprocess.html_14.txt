Title: Popen Attributes in Python's Subprocess Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
Summary: This section describes two important attributes of the Popen class in Python's subprocess module: 'pid', which reflects the process ID of the child process (or spawned shell if _shell is True), and 'returncode', which shows the exit status of the child process, initialized to None and set upon process termination by respective methods such as poll(), wait(), or communicate().
---

Popen.pid[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.pid "Link to this definition")
    
The process ID of the child process.
Note that if you set the _shell_ argument to `True`, this is the process ID of the spawned shell. 

Popen.returncode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.returncode "Link to this definition")
    
The child return code. Initially `None`, [`returncode`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.returncode "subprocess.Popen.returncode") is set by a call to the [`poll()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.poll "subprocess.Popen.poll"), [`wait()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait "subprocess.Popen.wait"), or [`communicate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate "subprocess.Popen.communicate") methods if they detect that the process has terminated.
A `None` value indicates that the process hadn’t yet terminated at the time of the last method call.
A negative value `-N` indicates that the child was terminated by signal `N` (POSIX only).
## Windows Popen Helpers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#windows-popen-helpers "Link to this heading")
The [`STARTUPINFO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.STARTUPINFO "subprocess.STARTUPINFO") class and following constants are only available on Windows. 

_class_ subprocess.STARTUPINFO(_*_ , _dwFlags =0_, _hStdInput =None_, _hStdOutput =None_, _hStdError =None_, _wShowWindow =0_, _lpAttributeList =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.STARTUPINFO "Link to this definition")
    
Partial support of the Windows [STARTUPINFO](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686331\(v=vs.85\).aspx) structure is used for [`Popen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen "subprocess.Popen") creation. The following attributes can be set by passing them as keyword-only arguments.
Changed in version 3.7: Keyword-only argument support was added. 

dwFlags[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.STARTUPINFO.dwFlags "Link to this definition")
    
A bit field that determines whether certain [`STARTUPINFO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.STARTUPINFO "subprocess.STARTUPINFO") attributes are used when the process creates a window.
```
si = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
si.dwFlags = subprocess.STARTF_USESTDHANDLES | subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW

Title: doctest.DocTestSuite
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
Summary: The `doctest.DocTestSuite` function converts doctest tests from a module into a `unittest.TestSuite`, which can be executed using the unittest framework. If any doctests fail, a `failureException` is raised, indicating the file and line number of the failure. The function also handles cases where all examples in a docstring are skipped.

doctest.DocTestSuite(_module =None_, _globs =None_, _extraglobs =None_, _test_finder =None_, _setUp =None_, _tearDown =None_, _optionflags =0_, _checker =None_)[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestSuite "Link to this definition")
    
Convert doctest tests for a module to a [`unittest.TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite").
The returned [`unittest.TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") is to be run by the unittest framework and runs each doctest in the module. If any of the doctests fail, then the synthesized unit test fails, and a [`failureException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.failureException "doctest.failureException") exception is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a (sometimes approximate) line number. If all the examples in a docstring are skipped, then the synthesized unit test is also marked as skipped.
Optional argument _module_ provides the module to be tested. It can be a module object or a (possibly dotted) module name. If not specified, the module calling this function is used.
Optional argument _globs_ is a dictionary containing the initial global variables for the tests. A new copy of this dictionary is created for each test. By default, _globs_ is a new empty dictionary.
Optional argument _extraglobs_ specifies an extra set of global variables, which is merged into _globs_. By default, no extra globals are used.
Optional argument _test_finder_ is the [`DocTestFinder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestFinder "doctest.DocTestFinder") object (or a drop-in replacement) that is used to extract doctests from the module.
Optional arguments _setUp_ , _tearDown_ , and _optionflags_ are the same as for function [`DocFileSuite()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocFileSuite "doctest.DocFileSuite") above.
This function uses the same search technique as [`testmod()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod").
Changed in version 3.5: [`DocTestSuite()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestSuite "doctest.DocTestSuite") returns an empty [`unittest.TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") if _module_ contains no docstrings instead of raising [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

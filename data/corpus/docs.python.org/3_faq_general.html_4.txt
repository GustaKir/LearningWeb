Title: Understanding Python Versioning
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html
Summary: This section explains the hierarchy of Python version numbers, detailing how alpha, beta, and release candidates precede actual releases. It also addresses the use of ‘+’ suffix in versioning, indicating unreleased versions from the development repository. Further resources include the Developer’s Guide and PEP 387 on backward compatibility.
---

In other words, all versions labeled _2.0aN_ precede the versions labeled _2.0bN_ , which precede versions labeled _2.0rcN_ , and _those_ precede 2.0.
You may also find version numbers with a “+” suffix, e.g. “2.2+”. These are unreleased versions, built directly from the CPython development repository. In practice, after a final minor release is made, the version is incremented to the next minor version, which becomes the “a0” version, e.g. “2.4a0”.
See the [Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/) for more information about the development cycle, and [**PEP 387**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/) to learn more about Python’s backward compatibility policy. See also the documentation for [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version "sys.version"), [`sys.hexversion`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hexversion "sys.hexversion"), and [`sys.version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info "sys.version_info").
### [How do I obtain a copy of the Python source?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id10)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-do-i-obtain-a-copy-of-the-python-source "Link to this heading")
The latest Python source distribution is always available from python.org, at <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. The latest development sources can be obtained at <https://github.com/python/cpython/>.
The source distribution is a gzipped tar file containing the complete C source, Sphinx-formatted documentation, Python library modules, example programs, and several useful pieces of freely distributable software. The source will compile and run out of the box on most UNIX platforms.
Consult the [Getting Started section of the Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/setup/) for more information on getting the source code and compiling it.
### [How do I get documentation on Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id11)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-do-i-get-documentation-on-python "Link to this heading")
The standard documentation for the current stable version of Python is available at <https://docs.python.org/3/>. PDF, plain text, and downloadable HTML versions are also available at <https://docs.python.org/3/download.html>.
The documentation is written in reStructuredText and processed by [the Sphinx documentation tool](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). The reStructuredText source for the documentation is part of the Python source distribution.
### [I’ve never programmed before. Is there a Python tutorial?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id12)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#i-ve-never-programmed-before-is-there-a-python-tutorial "Link to this heading")
There are numerous tutorials and books available. The standard documentation includes [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index).
Consult [the Beginner’s Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) to find information for beginning Python programmers, including lists of tutorials.
### [Is there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id13)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#is-there-a-newsgroup-or-mailing-list-devoted-to-python "Link to this heading")
There is a newsgroup, _comp.lang.python_ , and a mailing list, [python-list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list). The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other – if you can read news it’s unnecessary to subscribe to the mailing list. _comp.lang.python_ is high-traffic, receiving hundreds of postings every day, and Usenet readers are often more able to cope with this volume.
Announcements of new software releases and events can be found in comp.lang.python.announce, a low-traffic moderated list that receives about five postings per day. It’s available as [the python-announce mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/python-announce-list.python.org/).
More info about other mailing lists and newsgroups can be found at <https://www.python.org/community/lists/>.
### [How do I get a beta test version of Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id14)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-do-i-get-a-beta-test-version-of-python "Link to this heading")
Alpha and beta releases are available from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. All releases are announced on the comp.lang.python and comp.lang.python.announce newsgroups and on the Python home page at <https://www.python.org/>; an RSS feed of news is available.
You can also access the development version of Python through Git. See [The Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/) for details.
### [How do I submit bug reports and patches for Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id15)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-do-i-submit-bug-reports-and-patches-for-python "

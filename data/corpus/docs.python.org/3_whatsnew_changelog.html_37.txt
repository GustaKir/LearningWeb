Title: Python Updates: Formatting and Pathlib Improvements
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Recent updates include a fix for the embedded null character that no longer terminates format strings, changes to ensure arbitrary values aren't copied to _Bool in the struct module, and a solution to an issue with initializing PurePath objects that could incorrectly merge arguments from different parsers.
---

Embedded null character no longer terminates the format string.
  * [gh-125118](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125118): Don’t copy arbitrary values to _Bool in the [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#module-struct "struct: Interpret bytes as packed binary data.") module.
  * [gh-125069](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125069): Fix an issue where providing a [`pathlib.PurePath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath") object as an initializer argument to a second [`PurePath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath") object with a different [`parser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.parser "pathlib.PurePath.parser") resulted in arguments to the former object’s initializer being joined by the latter object’s parser.
  * [gh-125096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125096): If the [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL) environment variable is set, the [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module no longer imports the `_pyrepl` module. Moreover, the [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") module now respects [`-E`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-E) and [`-I`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-I) command line options: ignore [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL) in this case. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-124969](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124969): Fix `locale.nl_langinfo(locale.ALT_DIGITS)` on platforms with glibc. Now it returns a string consisting of up to 100 semicolon-separated symbols (an empty string in most locales) on all Posix platforms. Previously it only returned the first symbol or an empty string.
  * [gh-124960](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124960): Fix support for the `barry_as_FLUFL` future flag in the new REPL.
  * [gh-124984](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124984): Fixed thread safety in [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") in the free-threaded build. OpenSSL operations are now protected by a per-object lock.
  * [gh-124958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124958): Fix refcycles in exceptions raised from [`asyncio.TaskGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup") and the python implementation of [`asyncio.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future")
  * [gh-53203](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/53203): Fix [`time.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") for `%c` and `%x` formats in many locales: Arabic, Bislama, Breton, Bodo, Kashubian, Chuvash, Estonian, French, Irish, Ge’ez, Gurajati, Manx Gaelic, Hebrew, Hindi, Chhattisgarhi, Haitian Kreyol, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Marathi, Malay, Norwegian, Nynorsk, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Tok Pisin, Yoruba, Yue Chinese, Yau/Nungon and Chinese.
  * [gh-124917](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124917): Allow calling [`os.path.exists()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.exists "os.path.exists") and [`os.path.lexists()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.lexists "os.path.lexists") with keyword arguments on Windows. Fixes a regression in 3.13.0.
  * [gh-124653](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124653): Fix detection of the minimal Queue API needed by the [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") module.

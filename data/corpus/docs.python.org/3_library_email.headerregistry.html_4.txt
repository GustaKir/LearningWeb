Title: Email Header Registry - AddressHeader Class Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html
Summary: This section discusses the `AddressHeader` class, which offers a generic interface for complex address headers in email. It highlights the attribute 'groups', a tuple of `Group` objects that represent addresses and groups found in the header.

This example sets the date header to the current time and date using the current timezone offset. 

_class_ email.headerregistry.AddressHeader[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.AddressHeader "Link to this definition")
    
Address headers are one of the most complex structured header types. The `AddressHeader` class provides a generic interface to any address header.
This header type provides the following additional attributes: 

groups[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.AddressHeader.groups "Link to this definition")
    
A tuple of [`Group`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group "email.headerregistry.Group") objects encoding the addresses and groups found in the header value. Addresses that are not part of a group are represented in this list as single-address `Groups` whose [`display_name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group.display_name "email.headerregistry.Group.display_name") is `None`. 

addresses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.AddressHeader.addresses "Link to this definition")
    
A tuple of [`Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Address "email.headerregistry.Address") objects encoding all of the individual addresses from the header value. If the header value contains any groups, the individual addresses from the group are included in the list at the point where the group occurs in the value (that is, the list of addresses is “flattened” into a one dimensional list).
The `decoded` value of the header will have all encoded words decoded to unicode. [`idna`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-encodings.idna "encodings.idna: Internationalized Domain Names implementation") encoded domain names are also decoded to unicode. The `decoded` value is set by [joining](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#meth-str-join) the [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") value of the elements of the `groups` attribute with `', '`.
A list of [`Address`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Address "email.headerregistry.Address") and [`Group`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.Group "email.headerregistry.Group") objects in any combination may be used to set the value of an address header. `Group` objects whose `display_name` is `None` will be interpreted as single addresses, which allows an address list to be copied with groups intact by using the list obtained from the `groups` attribute of the source header. 

_class_ email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`AddressHeader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.AddressHeader "email.headerregistry.AddressHeader") that adds one additional attribute: 

address[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader.address "Link to this definition")
    
The single address encoded by the header value. If the header value actually contains more than one address (which would be a violation of the RFC under the default [`policy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages")), accessing this attribute will result in a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").
Many of the above classes also have a `Unique` variant (for example, `UniqueUnstructuredHeader`). The only difference is that in the `Unique` variant, [`max_count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.BaseHeader.max_count "email.headerregistry.BaseHeader.max_count") is set to 1. 

_class_ email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader "Link to this definition")
    
There is really only one valid value for the _MIME-Version_ header, and that is `1.0`. For future proofing, this header class supports other valid version numbers. If a version number has a valid value per [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html), then the header object will have non-`None` values for the following attributes: 

version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.headerregistry.html#email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader.version "Link to this definition")
    
The version number as a string, with any whitespace and/or comments removed.

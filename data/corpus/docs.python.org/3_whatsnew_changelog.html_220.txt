## Python 3.12.0 alpha 1[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-0-alpha-1 "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2022-10-25_
### Security[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id205 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-97616](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97616): Fix multiplying a list by an integer (`list *= int`): detect the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close to the maximum size. Issue reported by Jordan Limor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-97514](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97514): On Linux the [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") module returns to using filesystem backed unix domain sockets for communication with the _forkserver_ process instead of the Linux abstract socket namespace. Only code that chooses to use the [“forkserver” start method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) is affected.
Abstract sockets have no permissions and could allow any user on the system in the same [network namespace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html) (often the whole system) to inject code into the multiprocessing _forkserver_ process. This was a potential privilege escalation. Filesystem based socket permissions restrict this to the _forkserver_ process user as was the default in Python 3.8 and earlier.
This prevents Linux [**CVE 2022-42919**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-42919).
  * [gh-87389](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87389): [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers."): Fix an open redirection vulnerability in the HTTP server when an URI path starts with `//`. Vulnerability discovered, and initial fix proposed, by Hamza Avvan.
  * [gh-79096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79096): LWPCookieJar and MozillaCookieJar create files with file mode 600 instead of 644 (Microsoft Windows is not affected)
  * [gh-92888](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92888): Fix `memoryview` use after free when accessing the backing buffer in certain cases.
  * [gh-68966](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/68966): The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject unsafe text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into shell commands. Instead of using such text, it will warn and act as if a match was not found (or for test commands, as if the test failed).

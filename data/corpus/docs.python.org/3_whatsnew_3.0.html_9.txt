Title: Key Changes in Python 3.0
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
Summary: This document highlights significant changes introduced in Python 3.0, including the introduction of octal and binary literal support via PEP 3127, class decorators from PEP 3129, and the establishment of a numeric type hierarchy detailed in PEP 3141 through the new 'numbers' module.

conform to the [`collections.MutableMapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableMapping "collections.abc.MutableMapping") and [`collections.MutableSequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableSequence "collections.abc.MutableSequence") ABCs, respectively.
  * [PEP 3127: Integer Literal Support and Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3127). As mentioned above, the new octal literal notation is the only one supported, and binary literals have been added.
  * [PEP 3129: Class Decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3129).
  * [PEP 3141: A Type Hierarchy for Numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3141). The [`numbers`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#module-numbers "numbers: Numeric abstract base classes \(Complex, Real, Integral, etc.\).") module is another new use of ABCs, defining Python’s “numeric tower”. Also note the new [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions "fractions: Rational numbers.") module which implements [`numbers.Rational`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Rational "numbers.Rational").


## Library Changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#library-changes "Link to this heading")
Due to time constraints, this document does not exhaustively cover the very extensive changes to the standard library. [**PEP 3108**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3108/) is the reference for the major changes to the library. Here’s a capsule review:
  * Many old modules were removed. Some, like `gopherlib` (no longer used) and `md5` (replaced by [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.")), were already deprecated by [**PEP 4**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0004/). Others were removed as a result of the removal of support for various platforms such as Irix, BeOS and Mac OS 9 (see [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/)). Some modules were also selected for removal in Python 3.0 due to lack of use or because a better replacement exists. See [**PEP 3108**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3108/) for an exhaustive list.
  * The `bsddb3` package was removed because its presence in the core standard library has proved over time to be a particular burden for the core developers due to testing instability and Berkeley DB’s release schedule. However, the package is alive and well, externally maintained at <https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm>.
  * Some modules were renamed because their old name disobeyed [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), or for various other reasons. Here’s the list:
Old Name | New Name  
---|---  
_winreg | winreg  
ConfigParser | configparser  
copy_reg | copyreg  
Queue | queue  
SocketServer | socketserver  
markupbase | _markupbase  
repr | reprlib  
test.test_support | test.support  
  * A common pattern in Python 2.x is to have one version of a module implemented in pure Python, with an optional accelerated version implemented as a C extension; for example, [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") and `cPickle`. This places the burden of importing the accelerated version and falling back on the pure Python version on each user of these modules. In Python 3.0, the accelerated versions are considered implementation details of the pure Python versions. Users should always import the standard version, which attempts to import the accelerated version and falls back to the pure Python version. The [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") / `cPickle` pair received this treatment. The [`profile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile "profile: Python source profiler.") module is on the list for 3.1. The `StringIO` module has been turned into a class in the [`io`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io "io: Core tools for working with streams.") module.
  * Some related modules have been grouped into packages, and usually the submodule names have been simplified. The resulting new packages are:
    * [`dbm`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html#module-dbm "dbm: Interfaces to various Unix "database" formats.") (`anydbm`, `dbhash`, `dbm`, `dumbdbm`, `gdbm`, `whichdb`).
    * [`html`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#module-html "html: Helpers for manipulating HTML.") (`HTMLParser`, `htmlentitydefs`).
    * [`http`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#module-http "http: HTTP status codes and messages") (`httplib`, `BaseHTTPServer`, `CGIHTTPServer`, `SimpleHTTPServer`, `Cookie`, `cookielib`).
    * [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"

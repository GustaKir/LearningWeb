Title: unittest: FunctionTestCase and Test Case Execution
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
Summary: This section discusses the `unittest.FunctionTestCase` class, which supports running tests without providing error-checking methods. It facilitates the integration of legacy test code into the `unittest` framework, allowing for the organization and execution of test cases.
---

```

After running the test, `events` would contain `["setUp", "asyncSetUp", "test_response", "asyncTearDown", "tearDown", "cleanup"]`. 

_class_ unittest.FunctionTestCase(_testFunc_ , _setUp =None_, _tearDown =None_, _description =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.FunctionTestCase "Link to this definition")
    
This class implements the portion of the [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") interface which allows the test runner to drive the test, but does not provide the methods which test code can use to check and report errors. This is used to create test cases using legacy test code, allowing it to be integrated into a [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.")-based test framework.
### Grouping tests[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#grouping-tests "Link to this heading") 

_class_ unittest.TestSuite(_tests =()_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "Link to this definition")
    
This class represents an aggregation of individual test cases and test suites. The class presents the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to be run as any other test case. Running a [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instance is the same as iterating over the suite, running each test individually.
If _tests_ is given, it must be an iterable of individual test cases or other test suites that will be used to build the suite initially. Additional methods are provided to add test cases and suites to the collection later on.
[`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") objects behave much like [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") objects, except they do not actually implement a test. Instead, they are used to aggregate tests into groups of tests that should be run together. Some additional methods are available to add tests to [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instances: 

addTest(_test_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.addTest "Link to this definition")
    
Add a [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") or [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") to the suite. 

addTests(_tests_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.addTests "Link to this definition")
    
Add all the tests from an iterable of [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instances to this test suite.
This is equivalent to iterating over _tests_ , calling [`addTest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.addTest "unittest.TestSuite.addTest") for each element.
[`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") shares the following methods with [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"): 

run(_result_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.run "Link to this definition")
    
Run the tests associated with this suite, collecting the result into the test result object passed as _result_. Note that unlike [`TestCase.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.run "unittest.TestCase.run"), [`TestSuite.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run") requires the result object to be passed in. 

debug()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.debug "Link to this definition")
    
Run the tests associated with this suite without collecting the result. This allows exceptions raised by the test to be propagated to the caller and can be used to support running tests under a debugger. 

countTestCases()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite.countTestCases "Link to this definition")
    
Return the number of tests represented by this test object, including all individual tests and sub-suites.

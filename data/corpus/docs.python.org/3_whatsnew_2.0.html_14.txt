Summary: This section discusses the incompatibility between Python 2.0's XML package and the PyXML distribution. It highlights efforts by the XML Special Interest Group and provides a link to their resources for XML-related Python code.

Again, I will refer you to the Python documentation for a complete listing of the different `Node` classes and their various methods.
### Relationship to PyXML[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html#relationship-to-pyxml "Link to this heading")
The XML Special Interest Group has been working on XML-related Python code for a while. Its code distribution, called PyXML, is available from the SIG’s web pages at <https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/xml-sig>. The PyXML distribution also used the package name `xml`. If you’ve written programs that used PyXML, you’re probably wondering about its compatibility with the 2.0 [`xml`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#module-xml "xml: Package containing XML processing modules") package.
The answer is that Python 2.0’s [`xml`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#module-xml "xml: Package containing XML processing modules") package isn’t compatible with PyXML, but can be made compatible by installing a recent version PyXML. Many applications can get by with the XML support that is included with Python 2.0, but more complicated applications will require that the full PyXML package will be installed. When installed, PyXML versions 0.6.0 or greater will replace the [`xml`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#module-xml "xml: Package containing XML processing modules") package shipped with Python, and will be a strict superset of the standard package, adding a bunch of additional features. Some of the additional features in PyXML include:
  * 4DOM, a full DOM implementation from FourThought, Inc.
  * The xmlproc validating parser, written by Lars Marius Garshol.
  * The `sgmlop` parser accelerator module, written by Fredrik Lundh.

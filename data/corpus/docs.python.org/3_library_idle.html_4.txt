Title: IDLE Editing and Navigation Features
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html
Summary: The section covers the 'Squeeze' functionality in IDLE, which condenses output lines between the code and prompt into a 'Squeezed text' label. It explains how IDLE manages editor windows, emphasizing that only one editor window per file can be open, and describes essential window elements like the title and status bar. The document also indicates that files with a known .py extension are identified as Python code.

Squeeze
    
If the cursor is over an output line, squeeze all the output between the code above and the prompt below down to a ‘Squeezed text’ label.
## Editing and Navigation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#editing-and-navigation "Link to this heading")
### Editor windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#editor-windows "Link to this heading")
IDLE may open editor windows when it starts, depending on settings and how you start IDLE. Thereafter, use the File menu. There can be only one open editor window for a given file.
The title bar contains the name of the file, the full path, and the version of Python and IDLE running the window. The status bar contains the line number (‘Ln’) and column number (‘Col’). Line numbers start with 1; column numbers with 0.
IDLE assumes that files with a known .py* extension contain Python code and that other files do not. Run Python code with the Run menu.
### Key bindings[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html#key-bindings "Link to this heading")
The IDLE insertion cursor is a thin vertical bar between character positions. When characters are entered, the insertion cursor and everything to its right moves right one character and the new character is entered in the new space.
Several non-character keys move the cursor and possibly delete characters. Deletion does not puts text on the clipboard, but IDLE has an undo list. Wherever this doc discusses keys, ‘C’ refers to the `Control` key on Windows and Unix and the `Command` key on macOS. (And all such discussions assume that the keys have not been re-bound to something else.)
  * Arrow keys move the cursor one character or line.
  * `C`-`LeftArrow` and `C`-`RightArrow` moves left or right one word.
  * `Home` and `End` go to the beginning or end of the line.
  * `Page Up` and `Page Down` go up or down one screen.
  * `C`-`Home` and `C`-`End` go to beginning or end of the file.
  * `Backspace` and `Del` (or `C`-`d`) delete the previous or next character.
  * `C`-`Backspace` and `C`-`Del` delete one word left or right.
  * `C`-`k` deletes (‘kills’) everything to the right.

Title: Test Name Patterns in unittest
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
Summary: The 'testNamePatterns' attribute in unittest specifies Unix shell-style wildcard patterns that test methods must match to be included in test suites. If set, all test methods must conform to at least one pattern. Matches use 'fnmatch.fnmatchcase()' for wildcard matching. This feature was introduced in version 3.7.

testNamePatterns[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestLoader.testNamePatterns "Link to this definition")
    
List of Unix shell-style wildcard test name patterns that test methods have to match to be included in test suites (see `-k` option).
If this attribute is not `None` (the default), all test methods to be included in test suites must match one of the patterns in this list. Note that matches are always performed using [`fnmatch.fnmatchcase()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#fnmatch.fnmatchcase "fnmatch.fnmatchcase"), so unlike patterns passed to the `-k` option, simple substring patterns will have to be converted using `*` wildcards.
This affects all the `loadTestsFrom*` methods.
Added in version 3.7. 

_class_ unittest.TestResult[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "Link to this definition")
    
This class is used to compile information about which tests have succeeded and which have failed.
A [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object stores the results of a set of tests. The [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and [`TestSuite`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") classes ensure that results are properly recorded; test authors do not need to worry about recording the outcome of tests.
Testing frameworks built on top of [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") may want access to the [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object generated by running a set of tests for reporting purposes; a [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") instance is returned by the `TestRunner.run()` method for this purpose.
[`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") instances have the following attributes that will be of interest when inspecting the results of running a set of tests: 

errors[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.errors "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test which raised an unexpected exception. 

failures[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.failures "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test where a failure was explicitly signalled using the [assert* methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods). 

skipped[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.skipped "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings holding the reason for skipping the test.
Added in version 3.1. 

expectedFailures[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.expectedFailures "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents an expected failure or error of the test case. 

unexpectedSuccesses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances that were marked as expected failures, but succeeded. 

collectedDurations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.collectedDurations "Link to this definition")
    
A list containing 2-tuples of test case names and floats representing the elapsed time of each test which was run.
Added in version 3.12. 

shouldStop[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.shouldStop "Link to this definition")
    
Set to `True` when the execution of tests should stop by [`stop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop"). 

testsRun[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.testsRun "Link to this definition")
    
The total number of tests run so far.

### Mersenne Twister[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html#mersenne-twister "Link to this heading")
The `_random` C extension underlying the [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random "random: Generate pseudo-random numbers with various common distributions.") module includes code based on a download from <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html>. The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:
```
A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).

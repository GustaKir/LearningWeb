Title: App Store Compliance for Python Apps on iOS
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/ios.html
Summary: To distribute Python apps on iOS, they must pass Apple's app review process, which inspects for troublesome code. The Python standard library contains code that may violate these automated rules. To ensure compliance, developers may need to modify the library, with a patch file available in the Python source tree to remove problematic code.

## 7.3. App Store Compliance[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/ios.html#app-store-compliance "Link to this heading")
The only mechanism for distributing apps to third-party iOS devices is to submit the app to the iOS App Store; apps submitted for distribution must pass Apple’s app review process. This process includes a set of automated validation rules that inspect the submitted application bundle for problematic code.
The Python standard library contains some code that is known to violate these automated rules. While these violations appear to be false positives, Apple’s review rules cannot be challenged; so, it is necessary to modify the Python standard library for an app to pass App Store review.
The Python source tree contains [a patch file](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Mac/Resources/app-store-compliance.patch) that will remove all code that is known to cause issues with the App Store review process. This patch is applied automatically when building for iOS.

Title: Changes to C API Headers in Python 3.11
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html
Summary: In Python 3.11, the inclusion of several standard C header files by `<Python.h>` is updated. When using the `Py_LIMITED_API` macro at `0x030b0000` or higher, developers must now explicitly include these headers. Additionally, several non-limited API header files have been relocated to the `Include/cpython` directory, and the `eval.h` header file has been removed, necessitating the inclusion of `Python.h` instead.

  * `<Python.h>` no longer includes the header files `<stdlib.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<errno.h>` and `<string.h>` when the `Py_LIMITED_API` macro is set to `0x030b0000` (Python 3.11) or higher. C extensions should explicitly include the header files after `#include <Python.h>`. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-45434](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45434).)
  * The non-limited API files `cellobject.h`, `classobject.h`, `code.h`, `context.h`, `funcobject.h`, `genobject.h` and `longintrepr.h` have been moved to the `Include/cpython` directory. Moreover, the `eval.h` header file was removed. These files must not be included directly, as they are already included in `Python.h`: [Include Files](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#api-includes). If they have been included directly, consider including `Python.h` instead. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-35134](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35134).)
  * The `PyUnicode_CHECK_INTERNED()` macro has been excluded from the limited C API. It was never usable there, because it used internal structures which are not available in the limited C API. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-46007](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46007).)
  * The following frame functions and type are now directly available with `#include <Python.h>`, itâ€™s no longer needed to add `#include <frameobject.h>`:
    * [`PyFrame_Check()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_Check "PyFrame_Check")
    * [`PyFrame_GetBack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetBack "PyFrame_GetBack")
    * [`PyFrame_GetBuiltins()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetBuiltins "PyFrame_GetBuiltins")
    * [`PyFrame_GetGenerator()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetGenerator "PyFrame_GetGenerator")
    * [`PyFrame_GetGlobals()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetGlobals "PyFrame_GetGlobals")
    * [`PyFrame_GetLasti()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLasti "PyFrame_GetLasti")
    * [`PyFrame_GetLocals()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLocals "PyFrame_GetLocals")
    * [`PyFrame_Type`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_Type "PyFrame_Type")

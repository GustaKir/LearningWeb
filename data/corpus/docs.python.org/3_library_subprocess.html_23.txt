Title: Subprocess Module Attributes and Version Notes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
Summary: This section explains the safe use of certain attributes in the subprocess module, stating that they can be set to false without impact on older Python versions. It clarifies that a true value does not guarantee the function's usage and encourages users to report any issues encountered when using these attributes. Additionally, it lists attributes added in versions 3.8 and 3.11.
---

```

It is safe to set these to false on any Python version. They will have no effect on older versions when unsupported. Do not assume the attributes are available to read. Despite their names, a true value does not indicate that the corresponding function will be used, only that it may be.
Please file issues any time you have to use these private knobs with a way to reproduce the issue you were seeing. Link to that issue from a comment in your code.
Added in version 3.8: `_USE_POSIX_SPAWN`
Added in version 3.11: `_USE_VFORK`

Title: JSON Module Documentation - Basic Usage
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
Summary: The JSON module allows for serialization of Python objects to JSON format. It supports options for customization through parameters like `skipkeys`, `ensure_ascii`, and `indent`. Additionally, JSON is a subset of YAML, and this module's encoders and decoders maintain input and output order by default.

See [Command Line Interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json-commandline) for detailed documentation.
Note
JSON is a subset of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) 1.2. The JSON produced by this module’s default settings (in particular, the default _separators_ value) is also a subset of YAML 1.0 and 1.1. This module can thus also be used as a YAML serializer.
Note
This module’s encoders and decoders preserve input and output order by default. Order is only lost if the underlying containers are unordered.
## Basic Usage[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#basic-usage "Link to this heading") 

json.dump(_obj_ , _fp_ , _*_ , _skipkeys =False_, _ensure_ascii =True_, _check_circular =True_, _allow_nan =True_, _cls =None_, _indent =None_, _separators =None_, _default =None_, _sort_keys =False_, _** kw_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump "Link to this definition")
    
Serialize _obj_ as a JSON formatted stream to _fp_ (a `.write()`-supporting [file-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object)) using this [Python-to-JSON conversion table](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#py-to-json-table).
Note
Unlike [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") and [`marshal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html#module-marshal "marshal: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back \(with different constraints\)."), JSON is not a framed protocol, so trying to serialize multiple objects with repeated calls to [`dump()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump "json.dump") using the same _fp_ will result in an invalid JSON file.

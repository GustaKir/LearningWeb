Patch By Donghee Na.
  * [gh-106831](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106831): Fix potential missing `NULL` check of `d2i_SSL_SESSION` result in `_ssl.c`.
  * [gh-105481](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105481): The various opcode lists in the [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis "dis: Disassembler for Python bytecode.") module are now generated from bytecodes.c instead of explicitly constructed in opcode.py.
  * [gh-106727](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106727): Make [`inspect.getsource()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsource "inspect.getsource") smarter for class for same name definitions
  * [gh-106789](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106789): Remove import of [`pprint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html#module-pprint "pprint: Data pretty printer.") from [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information").
  * [gh-105726](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105726): Added `__slots__` to [`contextlib.AbstractContextManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AbstractContextManager "contextlib.AbstractContextManager") and [`contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager "contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager") so that child classes can use `__slots__`.
  * [gh-106774](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106774): Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.2.1.
  * [gh-106751](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106751): [`selectors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#module-selectors "selectors: High-level I/O multiplexing."): Optimize `EpollSelector.select()` code by moving some code outside of the loop.
  * [gh-106752](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106752): Fixed several bugs in zipfile.Path, including: in `zipfile.Path.match()`, Windows separators are no longer honored (and never were meant to be); Fixed `name`/`suffix`/`suffixes`/`stem` operations when no filename is present and the Path is not at the root of the zipfile; Reworked glob for performance and more correct matching behavior.
  * [gh-105293](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105293): Remove call to `SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context` during client side context creation in the [`ssl`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") module.
  * [gh-106734](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106734): Disable tab completion in multiline mode of [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  * [gh-105481](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105481): Expose opcode metadata through `_opcode`.
  * [gh-106670](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106670): Add the new `exceptions` command to the Pdb debugger. It makes it possible to move between chained exceptions when using post mortem debugging.
  * [gh-106602](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106602): Add __copy__ and __deepcopy__ in [`enum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#module-enum "enum: Implementation of an enumeration class.")
  * [gh-106664](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106664): [`selectors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#module-selectors "selectors: High-level I/O multiplexing."): Add `_SelectorMapping.get()` method and optimize `_SelectorMapping.__getitem__()`.
  * [gh-106628](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106628): Speed up parsing of emails by about 20% by not compiling a new regular expression for every single email.
  * [gh-89427](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89427): Set the environment variable `VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT` at [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "venv: Creation of virtual environments.") activation, even when `VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT` is set.
  * [gh-106530](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106530): Revert a change to [`colorsys.rgb_to_hls()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/colorsys.html#colorsys.rgb_to_hls "colorsys.rgb_to_hls") that caused division by zero for certain almost-white inputs. Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.
  * [gh-106584](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106584): Fix exit code for `unittest` if all tests are skipped.

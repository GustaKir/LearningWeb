Title: Curses Library Functions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html
Summary: This document chunk covers several functions from the curses library: `putp` for emitting terminal capabilities to standard output, `qiflush` for managing input queues based on a flag, and `raw` for entering raw mode by disabling normal input processing.
---

curses.putp(_str_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.putp "Link to this definition")
    
Equivalent to `tputs(str, 1, putchar)`; emit the value of a specified terminfo capability for the current terminal. Note that the output of [`putp()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.putp "curses.putp") always goes to standard output. 

curses.qiflush([_flag_])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.qiflush "Link to this definition")
    
If _flag_ is `False`, the effect is the same as calling [`noqiflush()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.noqiflush "curses.noqiflush"). If _flag_ is `True`, or no argument is provided, the queues will be flushed when these control characters are read. 

curses.raw()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.raw "Link to this definition")
    
Enter raw mode. In raw mode, normal line buffering and processing of interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow control keys are turned off; characters are presented to curses input functions one by one. 

curses.reset_prog_mode()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.reset_prog_mode "Link to this definition")
    
Restore the terminal to “program” mode, as previously saved by [`def_prog_mode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.def_prog_mode "curses.def_prog_mode"). 

curses.reset_shell_mode()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.reset_shell_mode "Link to this definition")
    
Restore the terminal to “shell” mode, as previously saved by [`def_shell_mode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.def_shell_mode "curses.def_shell_mode"). 

curses.resetty()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resetty "Link to this definition")
    
Restore the state of the terminal modes to what it was at the last call to [`savetty()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.savetty "curses.savetty"). 

curses.resize_term(_nlines_ , _ncols_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resize_term "Link to this definition")
    
Backend function used by [`resizeterm()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resizeterm "curses.resizeterm"), performing most of the work; when resizing the windows, [`resize_term()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resize_term "curses.resize_term") blank-fills the areas that are extended. The calling application should fill in these areas with appropriate data. The `resize_term()` function attempts to resize all windows. However, due to the calling convention of pads, it is not possible to resize these without additional interaction with the application. 

curses.resizeterm(_nlines_ , _ncols_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resizeterm "Link to this definition")
    
Resize the standard and current windows to the specified dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping data used by the curses library that record the window dimensions (in particular the SIGWINCH handler). 

curses.savetty()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.savetty "Link to this definition")
    
Save the current state of the terminal modes in a buffer, usable by [`resetty()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.resetty "curses.resetty"). 

curses.get_escdelay()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.get_escdelay "Link to this definition")
    
Retrieves the value set by [`set_escdelay()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.set_escdelay "curses.set_escdelay").
Added in version 3.9. 

curses.set_escdelay(_ms_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.set_escdelay "Link to this definition")
    
Sets the number of milliseconds to wait after reading an escape character, to distinguish between an individual escape character entered on the keyboard from escape sequences sent by cursor and function keys.
Added in version 3.9. 

curses.get_tabsize()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.get_tabsize "Link to this definition")
    
Retrieves the value set by [`set_tabsize()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.set_tabsize "curses.set_tabsize").
Added in version 3.9. 

curses.set_tabsize(_size_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.set_tabsize "Link to this definition")
    
Sets the number of columns used by the curses library when converting a tab character to spaces as it adds the tab to a window.
Added in version 3.9. 

curses.setsyx(_y_ , _x_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.setsyx "Link to this definition")
    
Set the virtual screen cursor to _y_ , _x_. If _y_ and _x_ are both `-1`, then [`leaveok`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.window.leaveok "curses.window.leaveok") is set `True`.

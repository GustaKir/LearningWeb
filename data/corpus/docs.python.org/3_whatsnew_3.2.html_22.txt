### sqlite3[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#sqlite3 "Link to this heading")
The [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") module was updated to pysqlite version 2.6.0. It has two new capabilities.
  * The `sqlite3.Connection.in_transit` attribute is true if there is an active transaction for uncommitted changes.
  * The [`sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension "sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension") and [`sqlite3.Connection.load_extension()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.load_extension "sqlite3.Connection.load_extension") methods allows you to load SQLite extensions from “.so” files. One well-known extension is the fulltext-search extension distributed with SQLite.

### html[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#html "Link to this heading")
A new [`html`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#module-html "html: Helpers for manipulating HTML.") module was introduced with only a single function, [`escape()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape "html.escape"), which is used for escaping reserved characters from HTML markup:
>>>```
>>> importhtml
>>> html.escape('x > 2 && x < 7')
'x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 7'

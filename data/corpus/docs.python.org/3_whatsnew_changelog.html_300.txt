Title: Build Enhancements in Python Configuration
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section outlines recent changes in Python's build configuration, including the removal of the static library when built with `--without-static-libpython`, and updates to the linking process in the absence of `--enable-shared`, ensuring all symbols are properly exported. Additionally, a new option has been introduced in the `configure` script.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id257 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-44133](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44133): When Python is configured with [`--without-static-libpython`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-static-libpython), the Python static library (libpython.a) is no longer built. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-44133](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44133): When Python is built without [`--enable-shared`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-shared), the `python` program is now linked to object files, rather than being linked to the Python static library (libpython.a), to make sure that all symbols are exported. Previously, the linker omitted some symbols like the `Py_FrozenMain()` function. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [bpo-40280](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40280): The `configure` script has a new option `--with-emscripten-target` to select browser or node as Emscripten build target.
  * [bpo-46315](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46315): Added and fixed `#ifdef HAVE_FEATURE` checks for functionality that is not available on WASI platform.
  * [bpo-45723](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45723): Fixed a regression in `configure` check for [`select.epoll()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.epoll "select.epoll").
  * [bpo-46263](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46263): `configure` no longer sets `MULTIARCH` on FreeBSD platforms.
  * [bpo-46106](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46106): Updated OpenSSL to 1.1.1m in Windows builds, macOS installer builds, and CI. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [bpo-46088](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46088): Automatically detect or install bootstrap Python runtime when building from Visual Studio.
  * [bpo-46072](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46072): Add a –with-pystats configure option to turn on internal statistics gathering.
  * [bpo-40280](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40280): A new directory `Tools/wasm` contains WebAssembly-related helpers like `config.site` override for wasm32-emscripten, wasm assets generator to bundle the stdlib, and a README.
  * [bpo-46023](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46023): **makesetup** no longer builds extensions that have been marked as _disabled_. This allows users to disable modules in `Modules/Setup.local`.
  * [bpo-45949](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=45949): Use pure Python `freeze_module` for all but importlib bootstrap files. `--with-freeze-module` **configure** option is no longer needed for cross builds.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id258 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-46217](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46217): Removed parameter that is unsupported on Windows 8.1 and early Windows 10 and may have caused build or runtime failures.


### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id259 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-40477](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40477): The Python Launcher app for macOS now properly launches scripts and, if necessary, the Terminal app when running on recent macOS releases.

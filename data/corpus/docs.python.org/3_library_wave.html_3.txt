Title: Wave_write.writeframes Method
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html
Summary: The writeframes method writes audio frames, ensuring the total number of written frames matches the pre-set nframes value. It raises an error if the output stream is non-seekable or if parameters are altered after calling the method. Since version 3.4, it accepts any bytes-like object.

writeframes(_data_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write.writeframes "Link to this definition")
    
Write audio frames and make sure _nframes_ is correct. It will raise an error if the output stream is not seekable and the total number of frames that have been written after _data_ has been written does not match the previously set value for _nframes_.
Changed in version 3.4: Any [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) is now accepted.
Note that it is invalid to set any parameters after calling [`writeframes()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write.writeframes "wave.Wave_write.writeframes") or [`writeframesraw()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write.writeframesraw "wave.Wave_write.writeframesraw"), and any attempt to do so will raise [`wave.Error`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#wave.Error "wave.Error").

---

thon 3.12b1 in [gh-103295](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103295). Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  * [gh-105875](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105875): SQLite 3.15.2 or newer is required to build the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") extension module. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  * [gh-90005](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90005): Fix a regression in `configure` where we could end up unintentionally linking with `libbsd`.
  * [gh-102404](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102404): Document how to perform a WASI build on Linux. Also add Tools/wasm/build_wasi.sh as a reference implementation of the docs.
  * [gh-89886](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89886): Autoconf 2.71 and aclocal 1.16.4 is now required to regenerate `!configure`.
  * [gh-104692](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104692): Include `commoninstall` as a prerequisite for `bininstall`
This ensures that `commoninstall` is completed before `bininstall` is started when parallel builds are used (`make -j install`), and so the `python3` symlink is only installed after all standard library modules are installed.
  * [gh-101538](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101538): Add experimental wasi-threads support. Patch by Takashi Yamamoto.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id136 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-110437](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110437): Allows overriding the source of VC redistributables so that releases can be guaranteed to never downgrade between updates.
  * [gh-109286](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109286): Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.43.1.
  * [gh-82367](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82367): [`os.path.realpath()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath "os.path.realpath") now resolves MS-DOS style file names even if the file is not accessible. Patch by Moonsik Park.
  * [gh-109991](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109991): Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.11.
  * [gh-106242](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106242): Fixes [`realpath()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath "os.path.realpath") to behave consistently when passed a path containing an embedded null character on Windows. In strict mode, it now raises [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") instead of the unexpected [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"), and in non-strict mode will make the path absolute.
  * [gh-83180](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83180): Changes the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) to prefer an active virtual environment when the launched script has a shebang line using a Unix-like virtual command, even if the command requests a specific version of Python.
  * [gh-106844](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106844): Fix integer overflow and truncating by the null character in `_winapi.LCMapStringEx()` which affects `ntpath.normcase()`.
  * [gh-105436](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105436): Ensure that an empty environment block is terminated by two null characters, as is required by Windows.
  * [gh-105146](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105146): Updated the links at the end of the installer to point to Discourse rather than the mailing lists.
  * [gh-103646](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103646): When installed from the Microsoft Store, `pip` no longer defaults to per-user installs. However, as the install directory is unwritable, it should automatically decide to do a per-user install anyway. This should resolve issues when `pip` is passed an option that conflicts with `--user`.
  * [gh-88745](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88745): Improve performance of [`shutil.copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") by using the operating system’s `CopyFile2` function. This may result in subtle changes to metadata copied along with some files, bringing them in line with normal OS behavior.
  * [gh-104820](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104820): Fixes [`stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") and related functions on file systems that do not support file ID requests. This includes FAT32 and exFAT.
  * [gh-104803](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104803): Add [`os.path.isdevdrive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isdevdrive "os.path.isdevdrive") to detect whether a path is on a Windows Dev Drive. Returns `False` on platforms that do not support Dev Drive, and is absent on non-Windows platforms.

Title: Email Errors in Python: Defects Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html
Summary: This document describes specific defects in the Python email library, including MalformedHeaderDefect, which indicates a faulty header structure, MultipartInvariantViolationDefect, which occurs when a multipart message lacks subparts, and InvalidBase64PaddingDefect, highlighting issues with Base64 encoding in email content.
---

_exception_ email.errors.MalformedHeaderDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MalformedHeaderDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A header was found that was missing a colon, or was otherwise malformed.
Deprecated since version 3.3: This defect has not been used for several Python versions. 

_exception_ email.errors.MultipartInvariantViolationDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MultipartInvariantViolationDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A message claimed to be a _multipart_ , but no subparts were found. Note that when a message has this defect, its [`is_multipart()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.compat32-message.html#email.message.Message.is_multipart "email.message.Message.is_multipart") method may return `False` even though its content type claims to be _multipart_. 

_exception_ email.errors.InvalidBase64PaddingDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.InvalidBase64PaddingDefect "Link to this definition")
    
When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the padding was not correct. Enough padding is added to perform the decode, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid. 

_exception_ email.errors.InvalidBase64CharactersDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.InvalidBase64CharactersDefect "Link to this definition")
    
When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, characters outside the base64 alphabet were encountered. The characters are ignored, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid. 

_exception_ email.errors.InvalidBase64LengthDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.InvalidBase64LengthDefect "Link to this definition")
    
When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the number of non-padding base64 characters was invalid (1 more than a multiple of 4). The encoded block was kept as-is. 

_exception_ email.errors.InvalidDateDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.InvalidDateDefect "Link to this definition")
    
When decoding an invalid or unparsable date field. The original value is kept as-is.

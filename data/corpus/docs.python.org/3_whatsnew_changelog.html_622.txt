Original patch by Saimadhav Heblikar.
  * [bpo-29910](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29910): IDLE no longer deletes a character after commenting out a region by a key shortcut. Add `return 'break'` for this and other potential conflicts between IDLE and default key bindings.
  * [bpo-30728](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30728): Review and change idlelib.configdialog names. Lowercase method and attribute names. Replace ‘colour’ with ‘color’, expand overly cryptic names, delete unneeded underscores. Replace `import *` with specific imports. Patches by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-6739](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6739): IDLE: Verify user-entered key sequences by trying to bind them with tk. Add tests for all 3 validation functions. Original patch by G Polo. Tests added by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-15786](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15786): Fix several problems with IDLE’s autocompletion box. The following should now work: clicking on selection box items; using the scrollbar; selecting an item by hitting Return. Hangs on MacOSX should no longer happen. Patch by Louie Lu.
  * [bpo-25514](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25514): Add doc subsubsection about IDLE failure to start. Popup no-connection message directs users to this section.
  * [bpo-30642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30642): Fix reference leaks in IDLE tests. Patches by Louie Lu and Terry Jan Reedy.
  * [bpo-30495](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30495): Add docstrings for textview.py and use PEP8 names. Patches by Cheryl Sabella and Terry Jan Reedy.
  * [bpo-30290](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30290): Help-about: use pep8 names and add tests. Increase coverage to 100%. Patches by Louie Lu, Cheryl Sabella, and Terry Jan Reedy.
  * [bpo-30303](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30303): Add _utest option to textview; add new tests. Increase coverage to 100%. Patches by Louie Lu and Terry Jan Reedy.
  * [bpo-29071](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29071): IDLE colors f-string prefixes (but not invalid ur prefixes).
  * [bpo-28572](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28572): Add 10% to coverage of IDLE’s test_configdialog. Update and augment description of the configuration system.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id568 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-30983](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30983): gdb integration commands (py-bt, etc.) work on optimized shared builds now, too. [**PEP 523**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0523/) introduced _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault which inlines PyEval_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds. This broke the ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py. Original patch by Bruno “Polaco” Penteado.
  * [bpo-29748](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29748): Added the slice index converter in Argument Clinic.
  * [bpo-24037](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24037): Argument Clinic now uses the converter `bool(accept={int})` rather than `int` for semantical booleans. This avoids repeating the default value for Python and C and will help in converting to `bool` in future.
  * [bpo-29367](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29367): python-gdb.py now supports also `method-wrapper` (`wrapperobject`) objects.
  * [bpo-28023](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28023): Fix python-gdb.py didn’t support new dict implementation.
  * [bpo-15369](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15369): The pybench and pystone microbenchmark have been removed from Tools. Please use the new Python benchmark suite <https://github.com/python/pyperformance> which is more reliable and includes a portable version of pybench working on Python 2 and Python 3.
  * [bpo-28102](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28102): The zipfile module CLI now prints usage to stderr. Patch by Stephen J. Turnbull.

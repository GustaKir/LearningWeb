### Library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id685 "Link to this heading")
  * Comment out socket (SO_REUSEPORT) and posix (O_SHLOCK, O_EXLOCK) constants exposed on the API which are not implemented on GNU/Hurd. They would not work at runtime anyway.
  * [bpo-27025](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27025): Generated names for Tkinter widgets are now more meaningful and recognizable.
  * [bpo-25455](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25455): Fixed crashes in repr of recursive ElementTree.Element and functools.partial objects.
  * [bpo-27294](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27294): Improved repr for Tkinter event objects.
  * [bpo-20508](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20508): Improve exception message of IPv{4,6}Network.__getitem__. Patch by Gareth Rees.
  * [bpo-21386](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21386): Implement missing IPv4Address.is_global property. It was documented since 07a5610bae9d. Initial patch by Roger Luethi.
  * [bpo-27029](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27029): Removed deprecated support of universal newlines mode from ZipFile.open().
  * [bpo-27030](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27030): Unknown escapes consisting of `'\'` and an ASCII letter in regular expressions now are errors. The re.LOCALE flag now can be used only with bytes patterns.
  * [bpo-27186](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27186): Add os.PathLike support to DirEntry (part of [**PEP 519**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0519/)). Initial patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-20900](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20900): distutils register command now decodes HTTP responses correctly. Initial patch by ingrid.
  * [bpo-27186](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27186): Add os.PathLike support to pathlib, removing its provisional status (part of PEP 519). Initial patch by Dusty Phillips.
  * [bpo-27186](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27186): Add support for os.PathLike objects to os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() (part of [**PEP 519**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0519/)).
  * [bpo-27186](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27186): Introduce os.PathLike and os.fspath() (part of [**PEP 519**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0519/)).
  * A new version of typing.py provides several new classes and features: @overload outside stubs, Reversible, DefaultDict, Text, ContextManager, Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug fixes (note that some of the new features are not yet implemented in mypy or other static analyzers). Also classes for [**PEP 492**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) (Awaitable, AsyncIterable, AsyncIterator) have been added (in fact they made it into 3.5.1 but were never mentioned).
  * [bpo-25738](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25738): Stop http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.send_error() from sending a message body for 205 Reset Content. Also, don’t send Content header fields in responses that don’t have a body. Patch by Susumu Koshiba.
  * [bpo-21313](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21313): Fix the “platform” module to tolerate when sys.version contains truncated build information.
  * [bpo-23883](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23883): Added missing APIs to __all__ to match the documented APIs for the following modules: cgi, mailbox, mimetypes, plistlib and smtpd. Patches by Jacek Kołodziej.
  * [bpo-27164](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27164): In the zlib module, allow decompressing raw Deflate streams with a predefined zdict. Based on patch by Xiang Zhang.
  * [bpo-24291](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24291): Fix wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler to completely write data to the client. Previously it could do partial writes and truncate data. Also, wsgiref.handler.ServerHandler can now handle stdout doing partial writes, but this is deprecated.
  * [bpo-21272](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21272): Use _sysconfigdata.py to initialize distutils.sysconfig.
  * [bpo-19611](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19611): [`inspect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#module-inspect "inspect: Extract information and source code from live objects.") now reports the implicit `.0` parameters generated by the compiler for comprehension and generator expression scopes as if they were positional-only parameters called `implicit0`. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-26809](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26809): Add `__all__` to [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations."). Patch by Emanuel Barry.
  * [bpo-26373](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26373): subprocess.Popen.communicate now correctly ignores BrokenPipeError when the child process dies

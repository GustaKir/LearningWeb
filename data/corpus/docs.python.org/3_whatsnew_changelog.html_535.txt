Title: Python 3.8 Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Recent changes include the renaming of the ‘wikipedia’ example to ‘rosette’, reduction of ‘penrose’ print output, and the elimination of the ‘1024’ output in ‘tree’. Several bugs were also fixed, addressing issues with string options in ttk widgets, IPv6 address resolution, random.choices() input handling, and integer overflow in os.readv() and os.writev().
---

The ‘wikipedia’ example is now ‘rosette’, describing what it draws. The ‘penrose’ print output is reduced. The’1024’ output of ‘tree’ is eliminated.
  * [bpo-33974](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33974): Fixed passing lists and tuples of strings containing special characters `"`, `\`, `{`, `}` and `\n` as options to [`ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set") widgets.
  * [bpo-27500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27500): Fix getaddrinfo to resolve IPv6 addresses correctly.
  * [bpo-24567](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24567): Improve random.choices() to handle subnormal input weights that could occasionally trigger an IndexError.
  * [bpo-33871](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33871): Fixed integer overflow in [`os.readv()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.readv "os.readv"), [`os.writev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.writev "os.writev"), [`os.preadv()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.preadv "os.preadv") and [`os.pwritev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pwritev "os.pwritev") and in [`os.sendfile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sendfile "os.sendfile") with _headers_ or _trailers_ arguments (on BSD-based OSes and macOS).
  * [bpo-25007](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25007): Add [`copy.copy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.copy "copy.copy") and [`copy.deepcopy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy "copy.deepcopy") support to zlib compressors and decompressors. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * [bpo-33929](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33929): multiprocessing: Fix a race condition in Popen of multiprocessing.popen_spawn_win32. The child process now duplicates the read end of pipe instead of “stealing” it. Previously, the read end of pipe was “stolen” by the child process, but it leaked a handle if the child process had been terminated before it could steal the handle from the parent process.
  * [bpo-33899](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33899): Tokenize module now implicitly emits a NEWLINE when provided with input that does not have a trailing new line. This behavior now matches what the C tokenizer does internally. Contributed by Ammar Askar.
  * [bpo-33897](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33897): Added a ‘force’ keyword argument to logging.basicConfig().
  * [bpo-33695](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33695): [`shutil.copytree()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree "shutil.copytree") uses [`os.scandir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir "os.scandir") function and all copy functions depending from it use cached [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") values. The speedup for copying a directory with 8000 files is around +9% on Linux, +20% on Windows and + 30% on a Windows SMB share. Also the number of [`os.stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") syscalls is reduced by 38% making [`shutil.copytree()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree "shutil.copytree") especially faster on network filesystems.

Title: Augmented Assignment Statements in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html
Summary: Augmented assignment statements perform a binary operation on a target and an expression, modifying the target in place and evaluating it only once. Unlike standard assignment, they evaluate the left-hand side before the right-hand side, leading to different behavior. An example shows how 'x += 1' can be rewritten as 'x = x + 1', but with important distinctions.

(See section [Primaries](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#primaries) for the syntax definitions of the last three symbols.)
An augmented assignment evaluates the target (which, unlike normal assignment statements, cannot be an unpacking) and the expression list, performs the binary operation specific to the type of assignment on the two operands, and assigns the result to the original target. The target is only evaluated once.
An augmented assignment statement like `x += 1` can be rewritten as `x = x + 1` to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented version, `x` is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, the actual operation is performed _in-place_ , meaning that rather than creating a new object and assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead.
Unlike normal assignments, augmented assignments evaluate the left-hand side _before_ evaluating the right-hand side. For example, `a[i] += f(x)` first looks-up `a[i]`, then it evaluates `f(x)` and performs the addition, and lastly, it writes the result back to `a[i]`.
With the exception of assigning to tuples and multiple targets in a single statement, the assignment done by augmented assignment statements is handled the same way as normal assignments. Similarly, with the exception of the possible _in-place_ behavior, the binary operation performed by augmented assignment is the same as the normal binary operations.
For targets which are attribute references, the same [caveat about class and instance attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#attr-target-note) applies as for regular assignments.
### 7.2.2. Annotated assignment statements[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#annotated-assignment-statements "Link to this heading")
[Annotation](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-variable-annotation) assignment is the combination, in a single statement, of a variable or attribute annotation and an optional assignment statement:
```
**annotated_assignment_stmt** ::= [augtarget](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-augtarget) ":" [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression)

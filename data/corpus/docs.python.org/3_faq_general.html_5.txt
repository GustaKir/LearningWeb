### [Are there any published articles about Python that I can reference?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id16)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#are-there-any-published-articles-about-python-that-i-can-reference "Link to this heading")
It’s probably best to cite your favorite book about Python.
The [very first article](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/18204) about Python was written in 1991 and is now quite outdated.
> Guido van Rossum and Jelke de Boer, “Interactively Testing Remote Servers Using the Python Programming Language”, CWI Quarterly, Volume 4, Issue 4 (December 1991), Amsterdam, pp 283–303.
### [Are there any books on Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id17)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#are-there-any-books-on-python "Link to this heading")
Yes, there are many, and more are being published. See the python.org wiki at <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks> for a list.
You can also search online bookstores for “Python” and filter out the Monty Python references; or perhaps search for “Python” and “language”.
### [Where in the world is www.python.org located?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id18)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#where-in-the-world-is-www-python-org-located "Link to this heading")
The Python project’s infrastructure is located all over the world and is managed by the Python Infrastructure Team. Details [here](https://infra.psf.io).
### [Why is it called Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id19)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python "Link to this heading")
When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from [“Monty Python’s Flying Circus”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

No, but it helps. :)

### [How stable is Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id22)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-stable-is-python "Link to this heading")
Very stable. New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every 6 to 18 months since 1991, and this seems likely to continue. As of version 3.9, Python will have a new feature release every 12 months ([**PEP 602**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0602/)).
The developers issue bugfix releases of older versions, so the stability of existing releases gradually improves. Bugfix releases, indicated by a third component of the version number (e.g. 3.5.3, 3.6.2), are managed for stability; only fixes for known problems are included in a bugfix release, and it’s guaranteed that interfaces will remain the same throughout a series of bugfix releases.
The latest stable releases can always be found on the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.x is the recommended version and supported by most widely used libraries. Python 2.x [**is not maintained anymore**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0373/).
### [How many people are using Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id23)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-many-people-are-using-python "Link to this heading")
There are probably millions of users, though it’s difficult to obtain an exact count.
Python is available for free download, so there are no sales figures, and it’s available from many different sites and packaged with many Linux distributions, so download statistics don’t tell the whole story either.
The comp.lang.python newsgroup is very active, but not all Python users post to the group or even read it.
### [Have any significant projects been done in Python?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id24)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#have-any-significant-projects-been-done-in-python "Link to this heading")
See <https://www.python.org/about/success> for a list of projects that use Python. Consulting the proceedings for [past Python conferences](https://www.python.org/community/workshops/) will reveal contributions from many different companies and organizations.
High-profile Python projects include [the Mailman mailing list manager](https://www.list.org) and [the Zope application server](https://www.zope.dev).

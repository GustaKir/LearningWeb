Summary: This document outlines several patches and bug fixes contributed by Matt Eaton to improve Python's standard library, including enhancements to exception messages in struct.unpack_from(), handling of SSL transport, a fix in the ipaddress module, the addition of the strsignal() function in the signal module, and corrections in the implementation of the ABC class.

Patch by Matt Eaton.
  * [bpo-30249](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30249): Improve struct.unpack_from() exception messages for problems with the buffer size and offset.
  * [bpo-33037](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33037): Skip sending/receiving data after SSL transport closing.
  * [bpo-27683](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27683): Fix a regression in [`ipaddress`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#module-ipaddress "ipaddress: IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library.") that result of `hosts()` is empty when the network is constructed by a tuple containing an integer mask and only 1 bit left for addresses.
  * [bpo-22674](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22674): Add the strsignal() function in the signal module that returns the system description of the given signal, as returned by strsignal(3).
  * [bpo-32999](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32999): Fix C implementation of `ABC.__subclasscheck__(cls, subclass)` crashed when `subclass` is not a type object.
  * [bpo-33009](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33009): Fix inspect.signature() for single-parameter partialmethods.
  * [bpo-32969](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32969): Expose several missing constants in zlib and fix corresponding documentation.
  * [bpo-32056](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32056): Improved exceptions raised for invalid number of channels and sample width when read an audio file in modules `aifc`, [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format.") and `sunau`.
  * [bpo-32970](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32970): Improved disassembly of the MAKE_FUNCTION instruction.
  * [bpo-32844](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32844): Fix wrong redirection of a low descriptor (0 or 1) to stderr in subprocess if another low descriptor is closed.
  * [bpo-32960](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32960): For dataclasses, disallow inheriting frozen from non-frozen classes, and also disallow inheriting non-frozen from frozen classes. This restriction will be relaxed at a future date.
  * [bpo-32713](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32713): Fixed tarfile.itn handling of out-of-bounds float values. Patch by Joffrey Fuhrer.
  * [bpo-32257](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32257): The ssl module now contains OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION constant, available with OpenSSL 1.1.0h or 1.1.1.
  * [bpo-32951](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32951): Direct instantiation of SSLSocket and SSLObject objects is now prohibited. The constructors were never documented, tested, or designed as public constructors. Users were suppose to use ssl.wrap_socket() or SSLContext.
  * [bpo-32929](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32929): Remove the tri-state parameter “hash”, and add the boolean “unsafe_hash”. If unsafe_hash is True, add a __hash__ function, but if a __hash__ exists, raise TypeError. If unsafe_hash is False, add a __hash__ based on the values of eq= and frozen=. The unsafe_hash=False behavior is the same as the old hash=None behavior.

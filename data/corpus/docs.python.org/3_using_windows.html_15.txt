Title: Python on Windows: Building and Executing Applications
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
Summary: This section covers cx_Freeze, a tool that converts Python scripts into executable Windows programs, allowing distribution without requiring a Python installation. It also outlines the steps to compile CPython on Windows, starting with obtaining the source and using Microsoft Visual Studio for the build process.

### 4.10.2. cx_Freeze[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#cx-freeze "Link to this heading")
[cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) wraps Python scripts into executable Windows programs (`_*_.exe`files). When you have done this, you can distribute your application without requiring your users to install Python.
## 4.11. Compiling Python on Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#compiling-python-on-windows "Link to this heading")
If you want to compile CPython yourself, first thing you should do is get the [source](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/). You can download either the latest release’s source or just grab a fresh [checkout](https://devguide.python.org/setup/#get-the-source-code).
The source tree contains a build solution and project files for Microsoft Visual Studio, which is the compiler used to build the official Python releases. These files are in the `PCbuild` directory.
Check `PCbuild/readme.txt` for general information on the build process.
For extension modules, consult [Building C and C++ Extensions on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/windows.html#building-on-windows).
## 4.12. Other Platforms[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#other-platforms "Link to this heading")
With ongoing development of Python, some platforms that used to be supported earlier are no longer supported (due to the lack of users or developers). Check [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) for details on all unsupported platforms.
  * [Windows CE](https://pythonce.sourceforge.net/) is [no longer supported](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71542) since Python 3 (if it ever was).
  * The [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) installer offers to install the [Python interpreter](https://cygwin.com/packages/summary/python3.html) as well

### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id731 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-5124](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5124): Paste with text selected now replaces the selection on X11. This matches how paste works on Windows, Mac, most modern Linux apps, and ttk widgets. Original patch by Serhiy Storchaka.
  * [bpo-24759](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24759): Make clear in idlelib.idle_test.__init__ that the directory is a private implementation of test.test_idle and tool for maintainers.
  * [bpo-27196](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27196): Stop ‘ThemeChanged’ warnings when running IDLE tests. These persisted after other warnings were suppressed in #20567. Apply Serhiy Storchaka’s update_idletasks solution to four test files. Record this additional advice in idle_test/README.txt
  * [bpo-20567](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20567): Revise idle_test/README.txt with advice about avoiding tk warning messages from tests. Apply advice to several IDLE tests.

  * [bpo-26673](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26673): When tk reports font size as 0, change to size 10. Such fonts on Linux prevented the configuration dialog from opening.

  * [bpo-25507](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25507): fix incorrect change in IOBinding that prevented printing. Augment IOBinding htest to include all major IOBinding functions.
  * [bpo-25905](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25905): Revert unwanted conversion of ‘ to ’ RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK in README.txt and open this and NEWS.txt with ‘ascii’. Re-encode CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with ‘utf-8’.

Title: Using Python on macOS: Package Management and GUI Programming
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html
Summary: This document discusses the MacPorts package manager for macOS, which provides multiple versions of Python and third-party packages. It highlights the potential lack of the latest software versions and recommends the Python Packaging User Guide for installing additional packages. Additionally, it mentions available options for GUI programming on macOS, notably using the standard toolkit, tkinter.

[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)
    
Another package manager for macOS including multiple versions of Python and many third-party Python-based packages. May include pre-built versions of Python and many packages for older versions of macOS.
Note that distributions might not include the latest versions of Python or other libraries, and are not maintained or supported by the core Python team.
## 5.3. Installing Additional Python Packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#installing-additional-python-packages "Link to this heading")
Refer to the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) for more information.
## 5.4. GUI Programming[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#gui-programming "Link to this heading")
There are several options for building GUI applications on the Mac with Python.
The standard Python GUI toolkit is [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"), based on the cross-platform Tk toolkit (<https://www.tcl.tk>). A macOS-native version of Tk is included with the installer.
_PyObjC_ is a Python binding to Apple’s Objective-C/Cocoa framework. Information on PyObjC is available from [pyobjc](https://pypi.org/project/pyobjc/).
A number of alternative macOS GUI toolkits are available including:
  * [PySide](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python): Official Python bindings to the [Qt GUI toolkit](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python).
  * [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/): Alternative Python bindings to Qt.
  * [Kivy](https://kivy.org): A cross-platform GUI toolkit that supports desktop and mobile platforms.
  * [Toga](https://toga.readthedocs.io): Part of the [BeeWare Project](https://beeware.org); supports desktop, mobile, web and console apps.
  * [wxPython](https://wxpython.org): A cross-platform toolkit that supports desktop operating systems.

Title: Understanding sitecustomize in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html
Summary: This section explains the `sitecustomize` module, which allows for site-specific customizations in Python. It discusses the process of importing `sitecustomize` after path manipulations and notes that if the import fails, it raises an `ImportError`.

```

Note that `bletch` is omitted because it doesn’t exist; the `bar` directory precedes the `foo` directory because `bar.pth` comes alphabetically before `foo.pth`; and `spam` is omitted because it is not mentioned in either path configuration file.
## [`sitecustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "sitecustomize")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "Link to this heading")
After these path manipulations, an attempt is made to import a module named [`sitecustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "sitecustomize"), which can perform arbitrary site-specific customizations. It is typically created by a system administrator in the site-packages directory. If this import fails with an [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") or its subclass exception, and the exception’s [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.name "ImportError.name") attribute equals to `'sitecustomize'`, it is silently ignored. If Python is started without output streams available, as with `pythonw.exe` on Windows (which is used by default to start IDLE), attempted output from [`sitecustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "sitecustomize") is ignored. Any other exception causes a silent and perhaps mysterious failure of the process.
## [`usercustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize "usercustomize")[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize "Link to this heading")
After this, an attempt is made to import a module named [`usercustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize "usercustomize"), which can perform arbitrary user-specific customizations, if [`ENABLE_USER_SITE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.ENABLE_USER_SITE "site.ENABLE_USER_SITE") is true. This file is intended to be created in the user site-packages directory (see below), which is part of `sys.path` unless disabled by [`-s`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-s). If this import fails with an [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") or its subclass exception, and the exception’s [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.name "ImportError.name") attribute equals to `'usercustomize'`, it is silently ignored.
Note that for some non-Unix systems, `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` are empty, and the path manipulations are skipped; however the import of [`sitecustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "sitecustomize") and [`usercustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize "usercustomize") is still attempted.
## Readline configuration[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#readline-configuration "Link to this heading")
On systems that support [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)"), this module will also import and configure the [`rlcompleter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/rlcompleter.html#module-rlcompleter "rlcompleter: Python identifier completion, suitable for the GNU readline library.") module, if Python is started in [interactive mode](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#tut-interactive) and without the [`-S`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-S) option. The default behavior is enable tab-completion and to use `~/.python_history` as the history save file. To disable it, delete (or override) the [`sys.__interactivehook__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.__interactivehook__ "sys.__interactivehook__") attribute in your [`sitecustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-sitecustomize "sitecustomize") or [`usercustomize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize "usercustomize") module or your [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) file.
Changed in version 3.4: Activation of rlcompleter and history was made automatic.

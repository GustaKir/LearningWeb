Title: Python Installation Options on Windows
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
Summary: This section details the installation options for Python on Windows, including the standard library, launcher, and pip installation. It explains the 'Customize installation' option for selecting features, the location for all-users installation requiring administrative approval, and the ability to compile the standard library to bytecode.

ge
  * The standard library, test suite, launcher and pip will be installed
  * If selected, the install directory will be added to your `PATH`
  * Shortcuts will only be visible for the current user


Selecting “Customize installation” will allow you to select the features to install, the installation location and other options or post-install actions. To install debugging symbols or binaries, you will need to use this option.
To perform an all-users installation, you should select “Customize installation”. In this case:
  * You may be required to provide administrative credentials or approval
  * Python will be installed into the Program Files directory
  * The [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) will be installed into the Windows directory
  * Optional features may be selected during installation
  * The standard library can be pre-compiled to bytecode
  * If selected, the install directory will be added to the system `PATH`
  * Shortcuts are available for all users


### 4.1.2. Removing the MAX_PATH Limitation[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#removing-the-max-path-limitation "Link to this heading")
Windows historically has limited path lengths to 260 characters. This meant that paths longer than this would not resolve and errors would result.
In the latest versions of Windows, this limitation can be expanded to approximately 32,000 characters. Your administrator will need to activate the “Enable Win32 long paths” group policy, or set `LongPathsEnabled` to `1` in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`.
This allows the [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") function, the [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") module and most other path functionality to accept and return paths longer than 260 characters.
After changing the above option, no further configuration is required.
Changed in version 3.6: Support for long paths was enabled in Python.
### 4.1.3. Installing Without UI[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-without-ui "Link to this heading")
All of the options available in the installer UI can also be specified from the command line, allowing scripted installers to replicate an installation on many machines without user interaction. These options may also be set without suppressing the UI in order to change some of the defaults.
The following options (found by executing the installer with `/?`) can be passed into the installer:
Name | Description  
---|---  
/passive | to display progress without requiring user interaction  
/quiet | to install/uninstall without displaying any UI  
/simple | to prevent user customization  
/uninstall | to remove Python (without confirmation)  
/layout [directory] | to pre-download all components  
/log [filename] | to specify log files location  
All other options are passed as `name=value`, where the value is usually `0` to disable a feature, `1` to enable a feature, or a path. The full list of available options is shown below.
Name | Description | Default  
---|---|---  
InstallAllUsers | Perform a system-wide installation. | 0  
TargetDir | The installation directory | Selected based on InstallAllUsers  
DefaultAllUsersTargetDir | The default installation directory for all-user installs | `%ProgramFiles%\Python X.Y` or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Python X.Y`  
DefaultJustForMeTargetDir | The default install directory for just-for-me installs | `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\PythonXY` or `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\PythonXY-32` or `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\PythonXY-64`  
DefaultCustomTargetDir | The default custom install directory displayed in the UI | (empty)  
AssociateFiles | Create file associations if the launcher is also installed. | 1  
CompileAll | Compile all `.py` files to `.pyc`. | 0  
PrependPath | Prepend install and Scripts directories to `PATH` and add `.PY` to `PATHEXT` | 0  
AppendPath | Append install and Scripts directories to `PATH` and add `.PY` to `PATHEXT` | 0  
Shortcuts | Create shortcuts for the interpreter, documentation and IDLE if installed. | 1  
Include_doc | Install Python manual | 1  
Include_debug | Install debug binaries | 0  
Include_dev | Install developer headers and libraries. Omitting this may lead to an unusable installation. | 1  
Include_exe | Install `python.exe` and related files. Omitting this may lead to an unusable installation. | 1  
Include_launcher | Install [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher). | 1  
InstallLauncherAllUsers | Installs the launcher for all users. Also requires `Include_launcher` to be set to 1 | 1  
Include_lib | Install standard library and extension modules. Omitting this may lead to an unusable installation. | 1  
Include_pip | Install bundled pip and setuptools | 1  
Include_symbols | Install debugging symbols (`*.p

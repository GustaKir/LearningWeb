Title: Python Configuration Options: Framework and Cross Compiling
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html
Summary: This section outlines key configuration options for building Python, including how to create a framework with a mandatory installation directory and specify its name. It also discusses cross compiling, which allows building Python for different CPU architectures or platforms, emphasizing the requirement for a matching version of the build Python interpreter.
---

--enable-framework=INSTALLDIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-3 "Link to this definition")
    
Create a Python.framework. Unlike macOS, the _INSTALLDIR_ argument specifying the installation path is mandatory. 

--with-framework-name=FRAMEWORK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-4 "Link to this definition")
    
Specify the name for the framework (default: `Python`).
### 3.3.15. Cross Compiling Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cross-compiling-options "Link to this heading")
Cross compiling, also known as cross building, can be used to build Python for another CPU architecture or platform. Cross compiling requires a Python interpreter for the build platform. The version of the build Python must match the version of the cross compiled host Python. 

--build=BUILD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-build "Link to this definition")
    
configure for building on BUILD, usually guessed by **config.guess**. 

--host=HOST[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-host "Link to this definition")
    
cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST (target platform) 

--with-build-python=path/to/python[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-build-python "Link to this definition")
    
path to build `python` binary for cross compiling
Added in version 3.11. 

CONFIG_SITE=file[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-arg-CONFIG_SITE "Link to this definition")
    
An environment variable that points to a file with configure overrides.
Example _config.site_ file:
```
# config.site-aarch64
ac_cv_buggy_getaddrinfo=no
ac_cv_file__dev_ptmx=yes
ac_cv_file__dev_ptc=no

```


HOSTRUNNER[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-arg-HOSTRUNNER "Link to this definition")
    
Program to run CPython for the host platform for cross-compilation.
Added in version 3.11.
Cross compiling example:
```
CONFIG_SITE=config.site-aarch64../configure\
--build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\
--host=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\
--with-build-python=../x86_64/python

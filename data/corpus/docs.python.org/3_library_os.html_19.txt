Title: os.writev() and os.pwrite() Functionality
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
Summary: This section discusses the behavior of certain operating system file writing functions in Python, emphasizing how the total number of bytes written may be limited by system configurations. It mentions the availability of these functionalities across different operating systems and specifies that certain flags are only applicable to more recent versions of Linux.
---

Return the total number of bytes actually written.
The operating system may set a limit ([`sysconf()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sysconf "os.sysconf") value `'SC_IOV_MAX'`) on the number of buffers that can be used.
Combine the functionality of [`os.writev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.writev "os.writev") and [`os.pwrite()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pwrite "os.pwrite").
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.30, FreeBSD >= 6.0, OpenBSD >= 2.7, AIX >= 7.1.
Using flags requires Linux >= 4.6.
Added in version 3.7. 

os.RWF_DSYNC[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.RWF_DSYNC "Link to this definition")
    
Provide a per-write equivalent of the [`O_DSYNC`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.O_DSYNC "os.O_DSYNC") [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") flag. This flag effect applies only to the data range written by the system call.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 4.7.
Added in version 3.7. 

os.RWF_SYNC[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.RWF_SYNC "Link to this definition")
    
Provide a per-write equivalent of the [`O_SYNC`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.O_SYNC "os.O_SYNC") [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") flag. This flag effect applies only to the data range written by the system call.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 4.7.
Added in version 3.7. 

os.RWF_APPEND[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.RWF_APPEND "Link to this definition")
    
Provide a per-write equivalent of the [`O_APPEND`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.O_APPEND "os.O_APPEND") [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") flag. This flag is meaningful only for [`os.pwritev()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pwritev "os.pwritev"), and its effect applies only to the data range written by the system call. The _offset_ argument does not affect the write operation; the data is always appended to the end of the file. However, if the _offset_ argument is `-1`, the current file _offset_ is updated.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 4.16.
Added in version 3.10. 

os.read(_fd_ , _n_ , _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.read "Link to this definition")
    
Read at most _n_ bytes from file descriptor _fd_.
Return a bytestring containing the bytes read. If the end of the file referred to by _fd_ has been reached, an empty bytes object is returned.
Note
This function is intended for low-level I/O and must be applied to a file descriptor as returned by [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") or [`pipe()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pipe "os.pipe"). To read a “file object” returned by the built-in function [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") or by [`popen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen "os.popen") or [`fdopen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fdopen "os.fdopen"), or [`sys.stdin`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdin "sys.stdin"), use its `read()` or `readline()` methods.
Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an [`InterruptedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#InterruptedError "InterruptedError") exception (see [**PEP 475**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0475/) for the rationale). 

os.sendfile(_out_fd_ , _in_fd_ , _offset_ , _count_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sendfile "Link to this definition")

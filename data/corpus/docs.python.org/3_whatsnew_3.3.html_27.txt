Title: Python 3.3 Updates: select, shlex, and shutil Modules
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html
Summary: The Python 3.3 release introduces a new class `select.devpoll` for high-performance asynchronous socket support on Solaris and related platforms. Additionally, the previously undocumented `quote` function from the `pipes` module has been moved to the `shlex` module, where it is now documented for escaping characters in strings used by shells.

### select[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#select "Link to this heading")
Solaris and derivative platforms have a new class [`select.devpoll`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.devpoll "select.devpoll") for high performance asynchronous sockets via `/dev/poll`. (Contributed by Jesús Cea Avión in [bpo-6397](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6397).)
### shlex[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#shlex "Link to this heading")
The previously undocumented helper function `quote` from the `pipes` modules has been moved to the [`shlex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#module-shlex "shlex: Simple lexical analysis for Unix shell-like languages.") module and documented. [`quote()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote "shlex.quote") properly escapes all characters in a string that might be otherwise given special meaning by the shell.
### shutil[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#shutil "Link to this heading")
  * New functions:
    * [`disk_usage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.disk_usage "shutil.disk_usage"): provides total, used and free disk space statistics. (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodolà in [bpo-12442](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12442).)
    * [`chown()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.chown "shutil.chown"): allows one to change user and/or group of the given path also specifying the user/group names and not only their numeric ids. (Contributed by Sandro Tosi in [bpo-12191](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12191).)
    * [`shutil.get_terminal_size()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.get_terminal_size "shutil.get_terminal_size"): returns the size of the terminal window to which the interpreter is attached. (Contributed by Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek in [bpo-13609](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13609).)
  * [`copy2()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2 "shutil.copy2") and [`copystat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copystat "shutil.copystat") now preserve file timestamps with nanosecond precision on platforms that support it. They also preserve file “extended attributes” on Linux. (Contributed by Larry Hastings in [bpo-14127](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=14127) and [bpo-15238](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15238).)
  * Several functions now take an optional `symlinks` argument: when that parameter is true, symlinks aren’t dereferenced and the operation instead acts on the symlink itself (or creates one, if relevant). (Contributed by Hynek Schlawack in [bpo-12715](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12715).)
  * When copying files to a different file system, [`move()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.move "shutil.move") now handles symlinks the way the posix `mv` command does, recreating the symlink rather than copying the target file contents. (Contributed by Jonathan Niehof in [bpo-9993](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=9993).) [`move()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.move "shutil.move") now also returns the `dst` argument as its result.
  * [`rmtree()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree "shutil.rmtree") is now resistant to symlink attacks on platforms which support the new `dir_fd` parameter in [`os.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open "os.open") and [`os.unlink()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.unlink "os.unlink"). (Contributed by Martin von Löwis and Hynek Schlawack in [bpo-4489](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=4489).)

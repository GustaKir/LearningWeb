URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html
Summary: This section describes several functions in the Python calendar module that return representations of the weeks in a specified month of a given year. The functions include 'monthdatescalendar', which returns weeks as lists of datetime.date objects; 'monthdays2calendar', which returns weeks as tuples of day and weekday numbers; and 'monthdayscalendar', which returns weeks as lists of day numbers.

monthdatescalendar(_year_ , _month_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.monthdatescalendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list of the weeks in the month _month_ of the _year_ as full weeks. Weeks are lists of seven [`datetime.date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date "datetime.date") objects. 

monthdays2calendar(_year_ , _month_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.monthdays2calendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list of the weeks in the month _month_ of the _year_ as full weeks. Weeks are lists of seven tuples of day numbers and weekday numbers. 

monthdayscalendar(_year_ , _month_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.monthdayscalendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return a list of the weeks in the month _month_ of the _year_ as full weeks. Weeks are lists of seven day numbers. 

yeardatescalendar(_year_ , _width =3_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.yeardatescalendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting. The return value is a list of month rows. Each month row contains up to _width_ months (defaulting to 3). Each month contains between 4 and 6 weeks and each week contains 1–7 days. Days are [`datetime.date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date "datetime.date") objects. 

yeardays2calendar(_year_ , _width =3_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.yeardays2calendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting (similar to [`yeardatescalendar()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.yeardatescalendar "calendar.Calendar.yeardatescalendar")). Entries in the week lists are tuples of day numbers and weekday numbers. Day numbers outside this month are zero. 

yeardayscalendar(_year_ , _width =3_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.yeardayscalendar "Link to this definition")
    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting (similar to [`yeardatescalendar()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.Calendar.yeardatescalendar "calendar.Calendar.yeardatescalendar")). Entries in the week lists are day numbers. Day numbers outside this month are zero. 

_class_ calendar.TextCalendar(_firstweekday =0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar "Link to this definition")
    
This class can be used to generate plain text calendars.
[`TextCalendar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar "calendar.TextCalendar") instances have the following methods: 

formatday(_theday_ , _weekday_ , _width_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar.formatday "Link to this definition")
    
Return a string representing a single day formatted with the given _width_. If _theday_ is `0`, return a string of spaces of the specified width, representing an empty day. The _weekday_ parameter is unused. 

formatweek(_theweek_ , _w =0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar.formatweek "Link to this definition")
    
Return a single week in a string with no newline. If _w_ is provided, it specifies the width of the date columns, which are centered. Depends on the first weekday as specified in the constructor or set by the [`setfirstweekday()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.setfirstweekday "calendar.setfirstweekday") method. 

formatweekday(_weekday_ , _width_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar.formatweekday "Link to this definition")
    
Return a string representing the name of a single weekday formatted to the specified _width_. The _weekday_ parameter is an integer representing the day of the week, where `0` is Monday and `6` is Sunday. 

formatweekheader(_width_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar.formatweekheader "Link to this definition")
    
Return a string containing the header row of weekday names, formatted with the given _width_ for each column. The names depend on the locale settings and are padded to the specified width. 

formatmonth(_theyear_ , _themonth_ , _w =0_, _l =0_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.TextCalendar.formatmonth "Link to this definition")
    
Return a month’s calendar in a multi-line string. If _w_ is provided, it specifies the width of the date columns, which are centered. If _l_ is given, it specifies the number of lines that each week will use. Depends on the first weekday as specified in the constructor or set by the [`setfirstweekday()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.setfirstweekday "calendar.setfirstweekday") method.

Title: Trace Module Options in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html
Summary: This section details the command-line options available for the Python trace module, including '--help' for usage information and '--version' to display the module version. It highlights that at least one main option must be specified when invoking the trace, and mentions the addition of the '--module' option in version 3.8.

```

The above will execute `somefile.py` and generate annotated listings of all Python modules imported during the execution into the current directory. 

--help[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-help "Link to this definition")
    
Display usage and exit. 

--version[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-version "Link to this definition")
    
Display the version of the module and exit.
Added in version 3.8: Added `--module` option that allows to run an executable module.
### Main options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#main-options "Link to this heading")
At least one of the following options must be specified when invoking [`trace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#module-trace "trace: Trace or track Python statement execution."). The [`--listfuncs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-l) option is mutually exclusive with the [`--trace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-t) and [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c) options. When [`--listfuncs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-l) is provided, neither [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c) nor [`--trace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-t) are accepted, and vice versa. 

-c, --count[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c "Link to this definition")
    
Produce a set of annotated listing files upon program completion that shows how many times each statement was executed. See also [`--coverdir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-C), [`--file`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-f) and [`--no-report`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-R) below. 

-t, --trace[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-t "Link to this definition")
    
Display lines as they are executed. 

-l, --listfuncs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-l "Link to this definition")
    
Display the functions executed by running the program. 

-r, --report[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-r "Link to this definition")
    
Produce an annotated list from an earlier program run that used the [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c) and [`--file`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-f) option. This does not execute any code. 

-T, --trackcalls[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-T "Link to this definition")
    
Display the calling relationships exposed by running the program.
### Modifiers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#modifiers "Link to this heading") 

-f, --file=<file>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-f "Link to this definition")
    
Name of a file to accumulate counts over several tracing runs. Should be used with the [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c) option. 

-C, --coverdir=<dir>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-C "Link to this definition")
    
Directory where the report files go. The coverage report for `package.module` is written to file `_dir_/_package_/_module_.cover`. 

-m, --missing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-m "Link to this definition")
    
When generating annotated listings, mark lines which were not executed with `>>>>>>`. 

-s, --summary[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-s "Link to this definition")
    
When using [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c) or [`--report`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-r), write a brief summary to stdout for each file processed. 

-R, --no-report[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-R "Link to this definition")
    
Do not generate annotated listings. This is useful if you intend to make several runs with [`--count`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-c), and then produce a single set of annotated listings at the end. 

-g, --timing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-g "Link to this definition")
    
Prefix each line with the time since the program started. Only used while tracing.
### Filters[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#filters "Link to this heading")
These options may be repeated multiple times. 

--ignore-module=<mod>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-ignore-module "Link to this definition")
    
Ignore each of the given module names and its submodules (if it is a package). The argument can be a list of names separated by a comma.

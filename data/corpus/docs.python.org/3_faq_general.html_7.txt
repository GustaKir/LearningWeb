With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as they are programming.
There are also good IDEs for Python. IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for Python that is written in Python using Tkinter. Emacs users will be happy to know that there is a very good Python mode for Emacs. All of these programming environments provide syntax highlighting, auto-indenting, and access to the interactive interpreter while coding. Consult [the Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) for a full list of Python editing environments.
If you want to discuss Python’s use in education, you may be interested in joining [the edu-sig mailing list](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig).

Title: AST Subclass Attributes Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html
Summary: In Python 3.13, instances of `ast.expr` and `ast.stmt` subclasses include attributes for tracking line and column information: `lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, and `end_col_offset`.

Added in version 3.13.

col_offset[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.col_offset "Link to this definition")


end_lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_lineno "Link to this definition")


end_col_offset[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_col_offset "Link to this definition")
    
Instances of `ast.expr` and `ast.stmt` subclasses have [`lineno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.lineno "ast.AST.lineno"), [`col_offset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.col_offset "ast.AST.col_offset"), [`end_lineno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_lineno "ast.AST.end_lineno"), and [`end_col_offset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_col_offset "ast.AST.end_col_offset") attributes. The [`lineno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.lineno "ast.AST.lineno") and [`end_lineno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_lineno "ast.AST.end_lineno") are the first and last line numbers of source text span (1-indexed so the first line is line 1) and the [`col_offset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.col_offset "ast.AST.col_offset") and [`end_col_offset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.AST.end_col_offset "ast.AST.end_col_offset") are the corresponding UTF-8 byte offsets of the first and last tokens that generated the node. The UTF-8 offset is recorded because the parser uses UTF-8 internally.
Note that the end positions are not required by the compiler and are therefore optional. The end offset is _after_ the last symbol, for example one can get the source segment of a one-line expression node using `source_line[node.col_offset : node.end_col_offset]`.
The constructor of a class `ast.T` parses its arguments as follows:
  * If there are positional arguments, there must be as many as there are items in `T._fields`; they will be assigned as attributes of these names.
  * If there are keyword arguments, they will set the attributes of the same names to the given values.


For example, to create and populate an [`ast.UnaryOp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.UnaryOp "ast.UnaryOp") node, you could use
```
node = ast.UnaryOp(ast.USub(), ast.Constant(5, lineno=0, col_offset=0),
          lineno=0, col_offset=0)

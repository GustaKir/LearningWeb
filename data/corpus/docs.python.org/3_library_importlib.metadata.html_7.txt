Title: DatabaseDistribution and Query Distributions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html
Summary: The `query_distributions` function retrieves records for distributions from a database based on a query. An example involving `requests-1.0` illustrates how it returns a `DatabaseDistribution` for specific contexts. The text discusses the importance of the `path` attribute, defaulting to `sys.path`, in influencing the results of `find_distributions`, especially when using a more advanced `DatabaseImporter`.
---

```

In this way, `query_distributions` would return records for each distribution served by the database matching the query. For example, if `requests-1.0` is in the database, `find_distributions` would yield a `DatabaseDistribution` for `Context(name='requests')` or `Context(name=None)`.
For the sake of simplicity, this example ignores `context.path`. The `path` attribute defaults to `sys.path` and is the set of import paths to be considered in the search. A `DatabaseImporter` could potentially function without any concern for a search path. Assuming the importer does no partitioning, the “path” would be irrelevant. In order to illustrate the purpose of `path`, the example would need to illustrate a more complex `DatabaseImporter` whose behavior varied depending on `sys.path`/`PYTHONPATH`. In that case, the `find_distributions` should honor the `context.path` and only yield `Distribution`s pertinent to that path.
`DatabaseDistribution`, then, would look something like:
```
classDatabaseDistribution(importlib.metadata.Distribution):
  def__init__(self, record):
    self.record = record
  defread_text(self, filename):
"""
    Read a file like "METADATA" for the current distribution.
    """
    if filename == "METADATA":
      return f"""Name: {self.record.name}
Version: {self.record.version}
"""
    if filename == "entry_points.txt":
      return "\n".join(
       f"""[{ep.group}]\n{ep.name}={ep.value}"""
       for ep in self.record.entry_points)
  deflocate_file(self, path):
    raise RuntimeError("This distribution has no file system")

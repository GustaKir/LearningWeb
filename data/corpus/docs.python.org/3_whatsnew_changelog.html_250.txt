Title: Python 3 Build Improvements
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section details enhancements to the Python build process, including fixes for the clang compiler's build process, updates to `wasm32-emscripten` builds to support additional modules, and the adoption of ThinLTO as the default optimization policy.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id210 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-96761](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96761): Fix the build process of clang compiler for **_bootstrap_python** if LTO optimization is applied. Patch by Matthias Görgens and Donghee Na.
  * [gh-96883](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96883): `wasm32-emscripten` builds for browsers now include [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures "concurrent.futures: Execute computations concurrently using threads or processes.") for [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") and [`unittest.mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#module-unittest.mock "unittest.mock: Mock object library.").
  * [gh-85936](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85936): CPython now uses the ThinLTO option as the default policy if the Clang compiler accepts the flag. Patch by Donghee Na.
  * [gh-96729](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96729): Ensure that Windows releases built with `Tools\msi\buildrelease.bat` are upgradable to and from official Python releases.
  * [gh-96269](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96269): Shared module targets now depend on new `MODULE_DEPS` variable, which includes `EXPORTSYMS`. This fixes a build order issue on unsupported AIX platform.
  * [gh-84461](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84461): `wasm32-emscripten` platform no longer builds [`resource`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#module-resource "resource: An interface to provide resource usage information on the current process. \(Unix\)") module, [`getresuid()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getresuid "os.getresuid"), [`getresgid()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getresgid "os.getresgid"), and their setters. The APIs are stubs and not functional.
  * [gh-95973](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95973): Add a new `--with-dsymutil` configure option to link debug information in macOS. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [gh-90536](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90536): Use the BOLT post-link optimizer to improve performance, particularly on medium-to-large applications.
  * [gh-93744](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93744): Remove the `configure --with-cxx-main` build option: it didn’t work for many years. Remove the `MAINCC` variable from `configure` and `Makefile`. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-94801](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94801): Fix a regression in `configure` script that caused some header checks to ignore custom `CPPFLAGS`. The regression was introduced in [gh-94802](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94802).
  * [gh-95145](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95145): wasm32-wasi builds no longer depend on WASIX’s pthread stubs. Python now has its own stubbed pthread API.
  * [gh-95174](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95174): Python now detects missing `dup` function in WASI and works around some missing [`errno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#module-errno "errno: Standard errno system symbols."), [`select`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#module-select "select: Wait for I/O completion on multiple streams."), and [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") constants.
  * [gh-95174](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95174): Python now skips missing [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") functions and methods on WASI. WASI can only create sockets from existing fd / accept and has no netdb.
  * [gh-95085](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95085): Platforms `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` and `wasm32-unknown-wasi` have been promoted to [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 3 platform support.
  * [gh-94847](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94847): Fixed `_decimal` module build issue on GCC when compiling with LTO and pydebug. Debug builds no longer force inlining of functions.
  * [gh-94841](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94841): Fix the possible performance regression of [`PyObject_Free()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#c.PyObject_Free "PyObject_Free") compiled with MSVC version 1932.
  * [gh-94801](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94801): `configure` now uses custom flags like `ZLIB_CFLAGS` and `ZLIB_LIBS` when searching for headers and libraries.
  * [gh-94773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94773): `deepfreeze.py` now supports code object with frozensets that contain incompatible, unsortable types.
  * [gh-94682](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94682): Build and test with OpenSSL 1.1.1q
  * [gh-90005](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90005): Dependencies of [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library

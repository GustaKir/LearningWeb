Title: Email Errors in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html
Summary: This document outlines specific exceptions in the Python email library, including the deprecated BoundaryError and the MultipartConversionError, which is raised when attempting to attach components to non-multipart email classes.
---

_exception_ email.errors.BoundaryError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.BoundaryError "Link to this definition")
    
Deprecated and no longer used. 

_exception_ email.errors.MultipartConversionError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MultipartConversionError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised if the [`attach()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.compat32-message.html#email.message.Message.attach "email.message.Message.attach") method is called on an instance of a class derived from [`MIMENonMultipart`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.mime.html#email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart "email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart") (e.g. [`MIMEImage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.mime.html#email.mime.image.MIMEImage "email.mime.image.MIMEImage")). [`MultipartConversionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MultipartConversionError "email.errors.MultipartConversionError") multiply inherits from [`MessageError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MessageError "email.errors.MessageError") and the built-in [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). 

_exception_ email.errors.HeaderWriteError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.HeaderWriteError "Link to this definition")
    
Raised when an error occurs when the [`generator`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.generator.html#module-email.generator "email.generator: Generate flat text email messages from a message structure.") outputs headers. 

_exception_ email.errors.MessageDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MessageDefect "Link to this definition")
    
This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email messages. It is derived from [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). 

_exception_ email.errors.HeaderDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.HeaderDefect "Link to this definition")
    
This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email headers. It is derived from [`MessageDefect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MessageDefect "email.errors.MessageDefect").
Here is the list of the defects that the [`FeedParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.parser.html#email.parser.FeedParser "email.parser.FeedParser") can find while parsing messages. Note that the defects are added to the message where the problem was found, so for example, if a message nested inside a _multipart/alternative_ had a malformed header, that nested message object would have a defect, but the containing messages would not.
All defect classes are subclassed from [`email.errors.MessageDefect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MessageDefect "email.errors.MessageDefect"). 

_exception_ email.errors.NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A message claimed to be a multipart, but had no _boundary_ parameter. 

_exception_ email.errors.StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect "Link to this definition")
    
The start boundary claimed in the _Content-Type_ header was never found. 

_exception_ email.errors.CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A start boundary was found, but no corresponding close boundary was ever found.
Added in version 3.3. 

_exception_ email.errors.FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect "Link to this definition")
    
The message had a continuation line as its first header line. 

_exception_ email.errors.MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A “Unix From” header was found in the middle of a header block. 

_exception_ email.errors.MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.errors.html#email.errors.MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect "Link to this definition")
    
A line was found while parsing headers that had no leading white space but contained no ‘:’. Parsing continues assuming that the line represents the first line of the body.
Added in version 3.3.

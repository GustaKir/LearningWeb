Summary: Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language suitable for various problem-solving tasks. Its extensive standard library includes modules for string processing, internet protocols, software engineering, and operating system interfaces.

### [What is Python good for?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id8)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python-good-for "Link to this heading")
Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.
The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index) to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org) to find packages of interest to you.
### [How does the Python version numbering scheme work?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id9)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-does-the-python-version-numbering-scheme-work "Link to this heading")
Python versions are numbered “A.B.C” or “A.B”:
  * _A_ is the major version number – it is only incremented for really major changes in the language.
  * _B_ is the minor version number – it is incremented for less earth-shattering changes.
  * _C_ is the micro version number – it is incremented for each bugfix release.


Not all releases are bugfix releases. In the run-up to a new feature release, a series of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or release candidate. Alphas are early releases in which interfaces aren’t yet finalized; it’s not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases. Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed to fix critical bugs.
Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix:
  * The suffix for an alpha version is “aN” for some small number _N_.
  * The suffix for a beta version is “bN” for some small number _N_.
  * The suffix for a release candidate version is “rcN” for some small number _N_.

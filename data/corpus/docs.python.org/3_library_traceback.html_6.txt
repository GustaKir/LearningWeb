Title: traceback.format_exception_only
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html
Summary: The `format_exception_only` function formats the exception part of a traceback, returning a generator of strings. When `show_group` is `False`, it provides the exception's message and notes, while with `show_group` set to `True`, it includes nested exceptions from `BaseExceptionGroup`, displayed according to their nesting depth.
---

format_exception_only(_*_ , _show_group =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.format_exception_only "Link to this definition")
    
Format the exception part of the traceback.
The return value is a generator of strings, each ending in a newline.
When _show_group_ is `False`, the generator emits the exception’s message followed by its notes (if it has any). The exception message is normally a single string; however, for [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") exceptions, it consists of several lines that (when printed) display detailed information about where the syntax error occurred.
When _show_group_ is `True`, and the exception is an instance of [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup"), the nested exceptions are included as well, recursively, with indentation relative to their nesting depth.
Changed in version 3.11: The exception’s [`notes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__notes__ "BaseException.__notes__") are now included in the output.
Changed in version 3.13: Added the _show_group_ parameter.
## `StackSummary` Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#stacksummary-objects "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.5.
`StackSummary` objects represent a call stack ready for formatting. 

_class_ traceback.StackSummary[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary "Link to this definition")
     

_classmethod_ extract(_frame_gen_ , _*_ , _limit =None_, _lookup_lines =True_, _capture_locals =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.extract "Link to this definition")
    
Construct a `StackSummary` object from a frame generator (such as is returned by [`walk_stack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.walk_stack "traceback.walk_stack") or [`walk_tb()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.walk_tb "traceback.walk_tb")).
If _limit_ is supplied, only this many frames are taken from _frame_gen_. If _lookup_lines_ is `False`, the returned [`FrameSummary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary "traceback.FrameSummary") objects will not have read their lines in yet, making the cost of creating the `StackSummary` cheaper (which may be valuable if it may not actually get formatted). If _capture_locals_ is `True` the local variables in each `FrameSummary` are captured as object representations.
Changed in version 3.12: Exceptions raised from [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr "repr") on a local variable (when _capture_locals_ is `True`) are no longer propagated to the caller. 

_classmethod_ from_list(_a_list_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.from_list "Link to this definition")
    
Construct a `StackSummary` object from a supplied list of [`FrameSummary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.FrameSummary "traceback.FrameSummary") objects or old-style list of tuples. Each tuple should be a 4-tuple with _filename_ , _lineno_ , _name_ , _line_ as the elements. 

format()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary.format "Link to this definition")
    
Returns a list of strings ready for printing. Each string in the resulting list corresponds to a single [frame](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects) from the stack. Each string ends in a newline; the strings may contain internal newlines as well, for those items with source text lines.
For long sequences of the same frame and line, the first few repetitions are shown, followed by a summary line stating the exact number of further repetitions.
Changed in version 3.6: Long sequences of repeated frames are now abbreviated.

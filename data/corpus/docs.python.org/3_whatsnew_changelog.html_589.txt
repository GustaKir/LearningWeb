Title: Python Changelog Summary - Performance Improvements and New Features
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document segment highlights several updates in Python, including the introduction of new methods itermonthdays3() and itermonthdays4() to handle date exceptions in Calendar, performance enhancements to shutil.rmtree() by 20-40%, and improvements in Pickler and Unpickler subclasses to eliminate reference cycles.
---

The pure SSE2 implementation is slower than the pure C reference implementation.
  * [bpo-28292](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28292): Calendar.itermonthdates() will now consistently raise an exception when a date falls outside of the 0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31 range. To support applications that cannot tolerate such exceptions, the new methods itermonthdays3() and itermonthdays4() are added. The new methods return tuples and are not restricted by the range supported by datetime.date.
  * [bpo-28564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28564): The shutil.rmtree() function has been sped up to 20–40%. This was done using the os.scandir() function.
  * [bpo-28416](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28416): Instances of pickle.Pickler subclass with the persistent_id() method and pickle.Unpickler subclass with the persistent_load() method no longer create reference cycles.
  * [bpo-31653](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31653): Don’t release the GIL if we can acquire a multiprocessing semaphore immediately.
  * [bpo-28326](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28326): Fix multiprocessing.Process when stdout and/or stderr is closed or None.
  * [bpo-20825](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20825): Add `subnet_of` and `superset_of` containment tests to [`ipaddress.IPv6Network`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") and [`ipaddress.IPv4Network`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network"). Patch by Michel Albert and Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31827](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31827): Remove the os.stat_float_times() function. It was introduced in Python 2.3 for backward compatibility with Python 2.2, and was deprecated since Python 3.1.
  * [bpo-31756](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31756): Add a `subprocess.Popen(text=False)` keyword argument to `subprocess` functions to be more explicit about when the library should attempt to decode outputs into text. Patch by Andrew Clegg.
  * [bpo-31819](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31819): Add AbstractEventLoop.sock_recv_into().
  * [bpo-31457](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31457): If nested log adapters are used, the inner `process()` methods are no longer omitted.
  * [bpo-31457](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31457): The `manager` property on LoggerAdapter objects is now properly settable.
  * [bpo-31806](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31806): Fix timeout rounding in time.sleep(), threading.Lock.acquire() and socket.socket.settimeout() to round correctly negative timeouts between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting for events as expected. Previously, the call was incorrectly non-blocking. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  * [bpo-31803](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31803): time.clock() and time.get_clock_info(‘clock’) now emit a DeprecationWarning warning.
  * [bpo-31800](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31800): Extended support for parsing UTC offsets. strptime ‘%z’ can now parse the output generated by datetime.isoformat, including seconds and microseconds.
  * [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28603): traceback: Fix a TypeError that occurred during printing of exception tracebacks when either the current exception or an exception in its context/cause chain is unhashable. Patch by Zane Bitter.
  * [bpo-30541](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30541): Add new function to seal a mock and prevent the automatically creation of child mocks.

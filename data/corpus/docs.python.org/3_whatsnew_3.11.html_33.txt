Title: Python 3.11 Changes: Removal of Unused Features
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html
Summary: In Python 3.11, several unused features were removed, including the `__class_getitem__()` method from `pathlib.PurePath`, the `MailmanProxy` class from the `smtpd` module, and the deprecated `split()` method of `_tkinter.TkappType`. Additionally, namespace package support was eliminated from the `unittest` module.

  * Removed the [`__class_getitem__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__class_getitem__ "object.__class_getitem__") method from [`pathlib.PurePath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath"), because it was not used and added by mistake in previous versions. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [bpo-46483](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46483).)
  * Removed the `MailmanProxy` class in the `smtpd` module, as it is unusable without the external `mailman` package. (Contributed by Donghee Na in [bpo-35800](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35800).)
  * Removed the deprecated `split()` method of `_tkinter.TkappType`. (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in [bpo-38371](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38371).)
  * Removed namespace package support from [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") discovery. It was introduced in Python 3.4 but has been broken since Python 3.7. (Contributed by Inada Naoki in [bpo-23882](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23882).)
  * Removed the undocumented private `float.__set_format__()` method, previously known as `float.__setformat__()` in Python 3.7. Its docstring said: “You probably don’t want to use this function. It exists mainly to be used in Python’s test suite.” (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [bpo-46852](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46852).)
  * The `--experimental-isolated-subinterpreters` configure flag (and corresponding `EXPERIMENTAL_ISOLATED_SUBINTERPRETERS` macro) have been removed.
  * [Pynche](https://pypi.org/project/Pynche/) — The Pythonically Natural Color and Hue Editor — has been moved out of `Tools/scripts` and is [being developed independently](https://gitlab.com/warsaw/pynche/-/tree/main) from the Python source tree.

Title: Environment Variables PYTHONBREAKPOINT and PYTHONDEBUG
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html
Summary: This section discusses the environment variable PYTHONBREAKPOINT, which allows users to specify a callable for debugging purposes, defaulting to 'pdb.set_trace' if not set. It also introduces the PYTHONDEBUG variable, highlighting its configuration options for debugging in Python.

PYTHONBREAKPOINT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONBREAKPOINT "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set, it names a callable using dotted-path notation. The module containing the callable will be imported and then the callable will be run by the default implementation of [`sys.breakpointhook()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.breakpointhook "sys.breakpointhook") which itself is called by built-in [`breakpoint()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint"). If not set, or set to the empty string, it is equivalent to the value “pdb.set_trace”. Setting this to the string “0” causes the default implementation of [`sys.breakpointhook()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.breakpointhook "sys.breakpointhook") to do nothing but return immediately.
Added in version 3.7. 

PYTHONDEBUG[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDEBUG "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the [`-d`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-d) option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying [`-d`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-d) multiple times.
This environment variable requires a [debug build of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build), otherwise it’s ignored. 

PYTHONINSPECT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONINSPECT "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the [`-i`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-i) option.
This variable can also be modified by Python code using [`os.environ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ "os.environ") to force inspect mode on program termination.
Raises an [auditing event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing) `cpython.run_stdin` with no arguments.
Changed in version 3.12.5: (also 3.11.10, 3.10.15, 3.9.20, and 3.8.20) Emits audit events.
Changed in version 3.13: Uses PyREPL if possible, in which case [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) is also executed. Emits audit events. 

PYTHONUNBUFFERED[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the [`-u`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u) option. 

PYTHONVERBOSE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONVERBOSE "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the [`-v`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-v) option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying [`-v`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-v) multiple times. 

PYTHONCASEOK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONCASEOK "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set, Python ignores case in [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements. This only works on Windows and macOS. 

PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set to a non-empty string, Python won’t try to write `.pyc` files on the import of source modules. This is equivalent to specifying the [`-B`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-B) option. 

PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX "Link to this definition")
    
If this is set, Python will write `.pyc` files in a mirror directory tree at this path, instead of in `__pycache__` directories within the source tree. This is equivalent to specifying the [`-X`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) `pycache_prefix=PATH` option.
Added in version 3.8. 

PYTHONHASHSEED[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED "Link to this definition")
    
If this variable is not set or set to `random`, a random value is used to seed the hashes of str and bytes objects.
If [`PYTHONHASHSEED`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED) is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.
Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash values.
The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.
Added in version 3.2.3.

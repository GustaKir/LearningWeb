Title: TarFile Methods: Retrieving Members and Their Names
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html
Summary: This section describes methods of the TarFile class in Python's tarfile library. It covers TarFile.getmembers(), which returns a list of TarInfo objects representing archive members, and TarFile.getnames(), which returns just the names of these members. Additionally, TarFile.list() is mentioned for printing the contents of the archive to standard output, with an option for verbose output.
---

TarFile.getmembers()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getmembers "Link to this definition")
    
Return the members of the archive as a list of [`TarInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarInfo "tarfile.TarInfo") objects. The list has the same order as the members in the archive. 

TarFile.getnames()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getnames "Link to this definition")
    
Return the members as a list of their names. It has the same order as the list returned by [`getmembers()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getmembers "tarfile.TarFile.getmembers"). 

TarFile.list(_verbose =True_, _*_ , _members =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.list "Link to this definition")
    
Print a table of contents to `sys.stdout`. If _verbose_ is [`False`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False "False"), only the names of the members are printed. If it is [`True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True "True"), output similar to that of **ls -l** is produced. If optional _members_ is given, it must be a subset of the list returned by [`getmembers()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getmembers "tarfile.TarFile.getmembers").
Changed in version 3.5: Added the _members_ parameter. 

TarFile.next()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.next "Link to this definition")
    
Return the next member of the archive as a [`TarInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarInfo "tarfile.TarInfo") object, when [`TarFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile "tarfile.TarFile") is opened for reading. Return [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") if there is no more available. 

TarFile.extractall(_path ='.'_, _members =None_, _*_ , _numeric_owner =False_, _filter =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall "Link to this definition")
    
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory or directory _path_. If optional _members_ is given, it must be a subset of the list returned by [`getmembers()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getmembers "tarfile.TarFile.getmembers"). Directory information like owner, modification time and permissions are set after all members have been extracted. This is done to work around two problems: A directory’s modification time is reset each time a file is created in it. And, if a directory’s permissions do not allow writing, extracting files to it will fail.
If _numeric_owner_ is [`True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True "True"), the uid and gid numbers from the tarfile are used to set the owner/group for the extracted files. Otherwise, the named values from the tarfile are used.
The _filter_ argument specifies how `members` are modified or rejected before extraction. See [Extraction filters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter) for details. It is recommended to set this explicitly depending on which _tar_ features you need to support.
Warning
Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of _path_ , e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with `"/"` or filenames with two dots `".."`.
Set `filter='data'` to prevent the most dangerous security issues, and read the [Extraction filters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter) section for details.
Changed in version 3.5: Added the _numeric_owner_ parameter.
Changed in version 3.6: The _path_ parameter accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).
Changed in version 3.12: Added the _filter_ parameter.

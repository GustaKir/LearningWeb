[bpo-25198](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25198): Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help. Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). Give code snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background. Re-use initial width and height set by users for shell and editor. When the Table of Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header at the top of the screen.
  * [bpo-25225](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25225): Condense and rewrite Idle doc section on text colors.
  * [bpo-21995](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21995): Explain some differences between IDLE and console Python.
  * [bpo-22820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22820): Explain need for _print_ when running file from Idle editor.
  * [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25224): Doc: augment Idle feature list and no-subprocess section.
  * [bpo-25219](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25219): Update doc for Idle command line options. Some were missing and notes were not correct.
  * [bpo-24861](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24861): Most of idlelib is private and subject to change. Use idleib.idle.* to start Idle. See idlelib.__init__.__doc__.
  * [bpo-25199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25199): Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.
  * [bpo-16893](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16893): Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Rose Roseman. The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are deprecated.
  * [bpo-24199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24199): Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.
  * [bpo-24790](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24790): Remove extraneous code (which also create 2 & 3 conflicts).

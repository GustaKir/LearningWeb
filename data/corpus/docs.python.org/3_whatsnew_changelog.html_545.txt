Title: Python 3.x Release Notes: Changelog
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document discusses recent updates in Python, including default settings for unsafe_hash, improvements to TLSv1.3 compatibility, updates in multiprocessing documentation, enhancements in the ssl module, filename encoding changes in dbm.open(), and optimizations in memory management within multiprocessing.
---

unsafe_hash=False is the default, just as hash=None used to be.
  * [bpo-32947](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32947): Add OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and test workaround for TLSv1.3 for future compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1.
  * [bpo-32146](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32146): Document the interaction between frozen executables and the spawn and forkserver start methods in multiprocessing.
  * [bpo-30622](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30622): The ssl module now detects missing NPN support in LibreSSL.
  * [bpo-32922](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32922): dbm.open() now encodes filename with the filesystem encoding rather than default encoding.
  * [bpo-32759](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32759): Free unused arenas in multiprocessing.heap.
  * [bpo-32859](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32859): In `os.dup2`, don’t check every call whether the `dup3` syscall exists or not.
  * [bpo-32556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32556): nt._getfinalpathname, nt._getvolumepathname and nt._getdiskusage now correctly convert from bytes.
  * [bpo-21060](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21060): Rewrite confusing message from setup.py upload from “No dist file created in earlier command” to the more helpful “Must create and upload files in one command”.
  * [bpo-32857](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32857): In [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"), `after_cancel(None)` now raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") instead of canceling the first scheduled function. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-32852](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32852): Make sure sys.argv remains as a list when running trace.
  * [bpo-31333](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31333): `_abc` module is added. It is a speedup module with C implementations for various functions and methods in `abc`. Creating an ABC subclass and calling `isinstance` or `issubclass` with an ABC subclass are up to 1.5x faster. In addition, this makes Python start-up up to 10% faster.
Note that the new implementation hides internal registry and caches, previously accessible via private attributes `_abc_registry`, `_abc_cache`, and `_abc_negative_cache`. There are three debugging helper methods that can be used instead `_dump_registry`, `_abc_registry_clear`, and `_abc_caches_clear`.
  * [bpo-32841](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32841): Fixed `asyncio.Condition` issue which silently ignored cancellation after notifying and cancelling a conditional lock. Patch by Bar Harel.
  * [bpo-32819](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32819): ssl.match_hostname() has been simplified and no longer depends on re and ipaddress module for wildcard and IP addresses. Error reporting for invalid wildcards has been improved.
  * [bpo-19675](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19675): `multiprocessing.Pool` no longer leaks processes if its initialization fails.
  * [bpo-32394](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32394): socket: Remove TCP_FASTOPEN,TCP_KEEPCNT,TCP_KEEPIDLE,TCP_KEEPINTVL flags on older version Windows during run-time.
  * [bpo-31787](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31787): Fixed refleaks of `__init__()` methods in various modules. (Contributed by Oren Milman)
  * [bpo-30157](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30157): Fixed guessing quote and delimiter in csv.Sniffer.sniff() when only the last field is quoted. Patch by Jake Davis.
  * [bpo-30688](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30688): Added support of `\N{name}` escapes in regular expressions. Based on patch by Jonathan Eunice.
  * [bpo-32792](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32792): collections.ChainMap() preserves the order of the underlying mappings.
  * [bpo-32775](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32775): [`fnmatch.translate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#fnmatch.translate "fnmatch.translate") no longer produces patterns which contain set operations. Sets starting with ‘[’ or containing ‘–’, ‘&&’, ‘~~’ or ‘||’ will be interpreted differently in regular expressions in future versions. Currently they emit warnings. fnmatch.translate() now avoids producing patterns containing such sets by accident.
  * [bpo-32622](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32622): Implement native fast sendfile for Windows proactor event loop.
  * [bpo-32777](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32777): Fix a rare but potential pre-exec child process deadlock in subprocess on POSIX systems when marking file descriptors inheritable on exec in the child process.

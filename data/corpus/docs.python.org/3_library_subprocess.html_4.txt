Title: subprocess.TimeoutExpired Exception
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
Summary: The `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception, a subclass of `SubprocessError`, is raised when a timeout occurs while waiting for a child process. It includes attributes such as `cmd` (the command that spawned the child process), `timeout` (the duration in seconds), and `output` (the captured output of the child process if applicable).

_exception_ subprocess.TimeoutExpired[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired "Link to this definition")
    
Subclass of [`SubprocessError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.SubprocessError "subprocess.SubprocessError"), raised when a timeout expires while waiting for a child process. 

cmd[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.cmd "Link to this definition")
    
Command that was used to spawn the child process. 

timeout[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.timeout "Link to this definition")
    
Timeout in seconds. 

output[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.output "Link to this definition")
    
Output of the child process if it was captured by [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run "subprocess.run") or [`check_output()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output "subprocess.check_output"). Otherwise, `None`. This is always [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") when any output was captured regardless of the `text=True` setting. It may remain `None` instead of `b''` when no output was observed. 

stdout[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.stdout "Link to this definition")
    
Alias for output, for symmetry with [`stderr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.stderr "subprocess.TimeoutExpired.stderr"). 

stderr[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.TimeoutExpired.stderr "Link to this definition")
    
Stderr output of the child process if it was captured by [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run "subprocess.run"). Otherwise, `None`. This is always [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") when stderr output was captured regardless of the `text=True` setting. It may remain `None` instead of `b''` when no stderr output was observed.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.5: _stdout_ and _stderr_ attributes added 

_exception_ subprocess.CalledProcessError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError "Link to this definition")
    
Subclass of [`SubprocessError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.SubprocessError "subprocess.SubprocessError"), raised when a process run by [`check_call()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call "subprocess.check_call"), [`check_output()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output "subprocess.check_output"), or [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run "subprocess.run") (with `check=True`) returns a non-zero exit status. 

returncode[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError.returncode "Link to this definition")
    
Exit status of the child process. If the process exited due to a signal, this will be the negative signal number. 

cmd[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError.cmd "Link to this definition")
    
Command that was used to spawn the child process. 

output[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError.output "Link to this definition")
    
Output of the child process if it was captured by [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run "subprocess.run") or [`check_output()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output "subprocess.check_output"). Otherwise, `None`. 

stdout[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError.stdout "Link to this definition")
    
Alias for output, for symmetry with [`stderr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CalledProcessError.stderr "subprocess.CalledProcessError.stderr").

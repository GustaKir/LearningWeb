Title: Changelog Summary for Python Features and Fixes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section of the changelog highlights several enhancements and fixes in Python, such as the addition of `exc_type_str`, extra tests for `random.binomialvariate()`, a bug fix in `readline` when used in sub-interpreters, improvements to the import time of the `pathlib` module, and modifications to the output of the `dis` module.
---

Add `exc_type_str` to replace it.
  * [gh-81620](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81620): Add extra tests for [`random.binomialvariate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.binomialvariate "random.binomialvariate")
  * [gh-112292](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112292): Fix a crash in [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)") when imported from a sub interpreter. Patch by Anthony Shaw
  * [gh-77621](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77621): Slightly improve the import time of the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#module-pathlib "pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths") module by deferring some imports. Patch by Barney Gale.
  * [gh-112137](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112137): Change [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis "dis: Disassembler for Python bytecode.") output to display logical labels for jump targets instead of offsets.
  * [gh-112139](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112139): Add `Signature.format()` to format signatures to string with extra options. And use it in [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") to render more readable signatures that have new lines between parameters.
  * [gh-112105](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112105): Make [`readline.set_completer_delims()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#readline.set_completer_delims "readline.set_completer_delims") work with libedit
  * [gh-106922](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106922): Display multiple lines with `traceback` when errors span multiple lines.
  * [gh-111874](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111874): When creating a [`typing.NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple "typing.NamedTuple") class, ensure [`__set_name__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__ "object.__set_name__") is called on all objects that define `__set_name__` and exist in the values of the `NamedTuple` class’s class dictionary. Patch by Alex Waygood.
  * [gh-68166](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/68166): Add support of the “vsapi” element type in [`tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create "tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create").
  * [gh-110275](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110275): Named tuple’s methods `_replace()` and `__replace__()` now raise TypeError instead of ValueError for invalid keyword arguments.
  * [gh-99367](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99367): Do not mangle `sys.path[0]` in [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") if safe_path is set
  * [gh-111615](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111615): Fix a regression caused by a fix to [gh-93162](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93162) whereby you couldn’t configure a `QueueHandler` without specifying handlers.
  * [gh-75666](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/75666): Fix the behavior of [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") widget’s `unbind()` method with two arguments. Previously, `widget.unbind(sequence, funcid)` destroyed the current binding for _sequence_ , leaving _sequence_ unbound, and deleted the _funcid_ command. Now it removes only _funcid_ from the binding for _sequence_ , keeping other commands, and deletes the _funcid_ command. It leaves _sequence_ unbound only if _funcid_ was the last bound command.
  * [gh-67790](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/67790): Implement basic formatting support (minimum width, alignment, fill) for [`fractions.Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.Fraction").
  * [gh-111049](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111049): Fix crash during garbage collection of the [`io.BytesIO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO") buffer object.
  * [gh-102980](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102980): Redirect the output of `interact` command of [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") to the same channel as the debugger.

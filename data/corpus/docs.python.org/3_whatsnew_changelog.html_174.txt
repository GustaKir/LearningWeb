  * [gh-104114](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104114): Fix issue where [`pathlib.Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") returns paths using the case of non-wildcard segments for corresponding path segments, rather than the real filesystem case.
  * [gh-104104](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104104): Improve performance of [`pathlib.Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") by using [`re.IGNORECASE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.IGNORECASE "re.IGNORECASE") to implement case-insensitive matching.
  * [gh-104102](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104102): Improve performance of [`pathlib.Path.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob "pathlib.Path.glob") when evaluating patterns that contain `'../'` segments.
  * [gh-103822](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103822): Update the return type of `weekday` to the newly added Day attribute
  * [gh-103629](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103629): Update the `repr` of [`typing.Unpack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Unpack "typing.Unpack") according to [**PEP 692**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/).
  * [gh-103963](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103963): Make [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis "dis: Disassembler for Python bytecode.") display the names of the args for `CALL_INTRINSIC_*`.
  * [gh-104035](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104035): Do not ignore user-defined `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods for slotted frozen dataclasses.
  * [gh-103987](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103987): In [`mmap`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html#module-mmap "mmap: Interface to memory-mapped files for Unix and Windows."), fix several bugs that could lead to access to memory-mapped files after they have been invalidated.
  * [gh-103977](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103977): Improve import time of [`platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#module-platform "platform: Retrieves as much platform identifying data as possible.") module.
  * [gh-88773](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88773): Added [`turtle.teleport()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.teleport "turtle.teleport") to the [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle "turtle: An educational framework for simple graphics applications") module to move a turtle to a new point without tracing a line, visible or invisible. Patch by Liam Gersten.
  * [gh-103935](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103935): Use [`io.open_code()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.open_code "io.open_code") for files to be executed instead of raw [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open")
  * [gh-68968](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/68968): Fixed garbled output of [`assertEqual()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") when an input lacks final newline.
  * [gh-100370](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100370): Fix potential [`OverflowError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError") in [`sqlite3.Connection.blobopen()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.blobopen "sqlite3.Connection.blobopen") for 32-bit builds. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.

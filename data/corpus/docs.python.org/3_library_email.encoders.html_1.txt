Title: Email Payload Encoders in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html
Summary: This section covers the functions for encoding email message payloads in Python, specifically `encode_quopri`, `encode_base64`, and `encode_7or8bit`. It describes when to use each encoding type, with `quoted-printable` for mostly printable data with some unprintable characters, and `base64` for predominantly unprintable data, noting that base64 results in non-human readable text.

email.encoders.encode_quopri(_msg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#email.encoders.encode_quopri "Link to this definition")
    
Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header to `quoted-printable` [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#id2). This is a good encoding to use when most of your payload is normal printable data, but contains a few unprintable characters. 

email.encoders.encode_base64(_msg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#email.encoders.encode_base64 "Link to this definition")
    
Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header to `base64`. This is a good encoding to use when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more compact form than quoted-printable. The drawback of base64 encoding is that it renders the text non-human readable. 

email.encoders.encode_7or8bit(_msg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#email.encoders.encode_7or8bit "Link to this definition")
    
This doesn’t actually modify the message’s payload, but it does set the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header to either `7bit` or `8bit` as appropriate, based on the payload data. 

email.encoders.encode_noop(_msg_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#email.encoders.encode_noop "Link to this definition")
    
This does nothing; it doesn’t even set the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header.
Footnotes
[[1](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#id1)]
Note that encoding with [`encode_quopri()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.encoders.html#email.encoders.encode_quopri "email.encoders.encode_quopri") also encodes all tabs and space characters in the data.

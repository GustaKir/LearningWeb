Title: Mac OS X Port-Specific Changes in Python 2.7
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html
Summary: This section outlines changes to Python 2.7 on Mac OS X, detailing the inclusion and subsequent removal of the `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages` directory from `sys.path` to facilitate package sharing between system and user-installed versions. Notably, from version 2.7.13 onwards, this directory is no longer appended, impacting the installation of pip components for user-installed Pythons.

### Port-Specific Changes: Mac OS X[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#port-specific-changes-mac-os-x "Link to this heading")
  * The path `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages` is now appended to `sys.path`, in order to share added packages between the system installation and a user-installed copy of the same version. (Changed by Ronald Oussoren; [bpo-4865](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=4865).)
Changed in version 2.7.13: As of 2.7.13, this change was removed. `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages`, the site-packages directory used by the Apple-supplied system Python 2.7 is no longer appended to `sys.path` for user-installed Pythons such as from the python.org installers. As of macOS 10.12, Apple changed how the system site-packages directory is configured, which could cause installation of pip components, like setuptools, to fail. Packages installed for the system Python will no longer be shared with user-installed Pythons. ([bpo-28440](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28440))


### Port-Specific Changes: FreeBSD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#port-specific-changes-freebsd "Link to this heading")
  * FreeBSD 7.1’s `SO_SETFIB` constant, used with the [`socket()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket "socket.socket") methods [`getsockopt()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.getsockopt "socket.socket.getsockopt")/[`setsockopt()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.setsockopt "socket.socket.setsockopt") to select an alternate routing table, is now available in the [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") module. (Added by Kyle VanderBeek; [bpo-8235](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=8235).)


## Other Changes and Fixes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#other-changes-and-fixes "Link to this heading")
  * Two benchmark scripts, `iobench` and `ccbench`, were added to the `Tools` directory. `iobench` measures the speed of the built-in file I/O objects returned by [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") while performing various operations, and `ccbench` is a concurrency benchmark that tries to measure computing throughput, thread switching latency, and IO processing bandwidth when performing several tasks using a varying number of threads.
  * The `Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py` script now understands plural forms in `.po` files. (Fixed by Martin von Löwis; [bpo-5464](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5464).)
  * When importing a module from a `.pyc` or `.pyo` file with an existing `.py` counterpart, the [`co_filename`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_filename "codeobject.co_filename") attributes of the resulting code objects are overwritten when the original filename is obsolete. This can happen if the file has been renamed, moved, or is accessed through different paths. (Patch by Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone; [bpo-1180193](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1180193).)
  * The `regrtest.py` script now takes a `--randseed=` switch that takes an integer that will be used as the random seed for the `-r` option that executes tests in random order. The `-r` option also reports the seed that was used (Added by Collin Winter.)
  * Another `regrtest.py` switch is `-j`, which takes an integer specifying how many tests run in parallel. This allows reducing the total runtime on multi-core machines. This option is compatible with several other options, including the `-R` switch which is known to produce long runtimes. (Added by Antoine Pitrou, [bpo-6152](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6152).) This can also be used with a new `-F` switch that runs selected tests in a loop until they fail. (Added by Antoine Pitrou; [bpo-7312](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=7312).)
  * When executed as a script, the `py_compile.py` module now accepts `'-'` as an argument, which will read standard input for the list of filenames to be compiled. (Contributed by Piotr Ożarowski; [bpo-8233](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=8233).)

Title: Resource Usage in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html
Summary: This section describes the return value from resource usage queries, detailing system resource usage such as user mode time and system mode time. The return value includes various fields, with the first two being floating-point values for user and system mode execution time, and other values being integers. For backward compatibility, the return value can also be accessed as a 16-element tuple. Additional details are available in the getrusage(2) man page.
---

```

The fields of the return value each describe how a particular system resource has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is user mode or number of times the process was swapped out of main memory. Some values are dependent on the clock tick internal, e.g. the amount of memory the process is using.
For backward compatibility, the return value is also accessible as a tuple of 16 elements.
The fields `ru_utime` and `ru_stime` of the return value are floating-point values representing the amount of time spent executing in user mode and the amount of time spent executing in system mode, respectively. The remaining values are integers. Consult the _[getrusage(2)](https://manpages.debian.org/getrusage\(2\))_ man page for detailed information about these values. A brief summary is presented here:
Index | Field | Resource  
---|---|---  
`0` | `ru_utime` | time in user mode (float seconds)  
`1` | `ru_stime` | time in system mode (float seconds)  
`2` | `ru_maxrss` | maximum resident set size  
`3` | `ru_ixrss` | shared memory size  
`4` | `ru_idrss` | unshared memory size  
`5` | `ru_isrss` | unshared stack size  
`6` | `ru_minflt` | page faults not requiring I/O  
`7` | `ru_majflt` | page faults requiring I/O  
`8` | `ru_nswap` | number of swap outs  
`9` | `ru_inblock` | block input operations  
`10` | `ru_oublock` | block output operations  
`11` | `ru_msgsnd` | messages sent  
`12` | `ru_msgrcv` | messages received  
`13` | `ru_nsignals` | signals received  
`14` | `ru_nvcsw` | voluntary context switches  
`15` | `ru_nivcsw` | involuntary context switches  
This function will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if an invalid _who_ parameter is specified. It may also raise [`error`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.error "resource.error") exception in unusual circumstances. 

resource.getpagesize()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getpagesize "Link to this definition")
    
Returns the number of bytes in a system page. (This need not be the same as the hardware page size.)
The following `RUSAGE_*` symbols are passed to the [`getrusage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrusage "resource.getrusage") function to specify which processes information should be provided for. 

resource.RUSAGE_SELF[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RUSAGE_SELF "Link to this definition")
    
Pass to [`getrusage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrusage "resource.getrusage") to request resources consumed by the calling process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process. 

resource.RUSAGE_CHILDREN[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RUSAGE_CHILDREN "Link to this definition")
    
Pass to [`getrusage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrusage "resource.getrusage") to request resources consumed by child processes of the calling process which have been terminated and waited for. 

resource.RUSAGE_BOTH[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RUSAGE_BOTH "Link to this definition")
    
Pass to [`getrusage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrusage "resource.getrusage") to request resources consumed by both the current process and child processes. May not be available on all systems. 

resource.RUSAGE_THREAD[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RUSAGE_THREAD "Link to this definition")
    
Pass to [`getrusage()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrusage "resource.getrusage") to request resources consumed by the current thread. May not be available on all systems.
Added in version 3.2.

Title: Embedding the CPython Runtime in a Larger Application
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html
Summary: This section discusses the process of embedding the CPython runtime within a larger application instead of creating an extension that runs solely within the Python interpreter. It includes various levels of embedding and extension techniques.

## Embedding the CPython runtime in a larger application[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#embedding-the-cpython-runtime-in-a-larger-application "Link to this heading")
Sometimes, rather than creating an extension that runs inside the Python interpreter as the main application, it is desirable to instead embed the CPython runtime inside a larger application. This section covers some of the details involved in doing that successfully.

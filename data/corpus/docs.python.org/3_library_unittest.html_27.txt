Title: unittest.TestResult Parameters
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
Summary: This section describes parameters for unittest's TestResult class. The 'buffer' parameter enables buffering of stdout and stderr, which is only displayed on failure or error. The 'failfast' parameter stops the test run on the first failure or error. Both features were added in version 3.2.

buffer[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.buffer "Link to this definition")
    
If set to true, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` will be buffered in between [`startTest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.startTest "unittest.TestResult.startTest") and [`stopTest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stopTest "unittest.TestResult.stopTest") being called. Collected output will only be echoed onto the real `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` if the test fails or errors. Any output is also attached to the failure / error message.
Added in version 3.2. 

failfast[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.failfast "Link to this definition")
    
If set to true [`stop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop") will be called on the first failure or error, halting the test run.
Added in version 3.2. 

tb_locals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.tb_locals "Link to this definition")
    
If set to true then local variables will be shown in tracebacks.
Added in version 3.5. 

wasSuccessful()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.wasSuccessful "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if all tests run so far have passed, otherwise returns `False`.
Changed in version 3.4: Returns `False` if there were any [`unexpectedSuccesses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses "unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses") from tests marked with the [`expectedFailure()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.expectedFailure "unittest.expectedFailure") decorator. 

stop()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stop "Link to this definition")
    
This method can be called to signal that the set of tests being run should be aborted by setting the [`shouldStop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.shouldStop "unittest.TestResult.shouldStop") attribute to `True`. `TestRunner` objects should respect this flag and return without running any additional tests.
For example, this feature is used by the [`TextTestRunner`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TextTestRunner "unittest.TextTestRunner") class to stop the test framework when the user signals an interrupt from the keyboard. Interactive tools which provide `TestRunner` implementations can use this in a similar manner.
The following methods of the [`TestResult`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") class are used to maintain the internal data structures, and may be extended in subclasses to support additional reporting requirements. This is particularly useful in building tools which support interactive reporting while tests are being run. 

startTest(_test_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.startTest "Link to this definition")
    
Called when the test case _test_ is about to be run. 

stopTest(_test_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stopTest "Link to this definition")
    
Called after the test case _test_ has been executed, regardless of the outcome. 

startTestRun()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.startTestRun "Link to this definition")
    
Called once before any tests are executed.
Added in version 3.1. 

stopTestRun()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.stopTestRun "Link to this definition")
    
Called once after all tests are executed.
Added in version 3.1. 

addError(_test_ , _err_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.addError "Link to this definition")
    
Called when the test case _test_ raises an unexpected exception. _err_ is a tuple of the form returned by [`sys.exc_info()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info"): `(type, value, traceback)`.
The default implementation appends a tuple `(test, formatted_err)` to the instance’s [`errors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestResult.errors "unittest.TestResult.errors") attribute, where _formatted_err_ is a formatted traceback derived from _err_.

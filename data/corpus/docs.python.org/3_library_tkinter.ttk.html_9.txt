Title: Treeview Widget in Tkinter
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html
Summary: The `ttk.Treeview` widget presents a hierarchical collection of items, each with a label, optional image, and data values. The display of data can be managed through the `displaycolumns` option, and columns can have headings. Items are uniquely identified, with a root item present that is not displayed but holds children at the top level. Items can also have associated tags.

## Treeview[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#treeview "Link to this heading")
The `ttk.Treeview` widget displays a hierarchical collection of items. Each item has a textual label, an optional image, and an optional list of data values. The data values are displayed in successive columns after the tree label.
The order in which data values are displayed may be controlled by setting the widget option `displaycolumns`. The tree widget can also display column headings. Columns may be accessed by number or symbolic names listed in the widget option columns. See [Column Identifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#column-identifiers).
Each item is identified by a unique name. The widget will generate item IDs if they are not supplied by the caller. There is a distinguished root item, named `{}`. The root item itself is not displayed; its children appear at the top level of the hierarchy.
Each item also has a list of tags, which can be used to associate event bindings with individual items and control the appearance of the item.
The Treeview widget supports horizontal and vertical scrolling, according to the options described in [Scrollable Widget Options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#scrollable-widget-options) and the methods [`Treeview.xview()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Treeview.xview "tkinter.ttk.Treeview.xview") and [`Treeview.yview()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Treeview.yview "tkinter.ttk.Treeview.yview").
### Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#id7 "Link to this heading")
This widget accepts the following specific options:
Option | Description  
---|---  
columns | A list of column identifiers, specifying the number of columns and their names.  
displaycolumns | A list of column identifiers (either symbolic or integer indices) specifying which data columns are displayed and the order in which they appear, or the string “#all”.  
height | Specifies the number of rows which should be visible. Note: the requested width is determined from the sum of the column widths.  
padding | Specifies the internal padding for the widget. The padding is a list of up to four length specifications.  
selectmode | Controls how the built-in class bindings manage the selection. One of “extended”, “browse” or “none”. If set to “extended” (the default), multiple items may be selected. If “browse”, only a single item will be selected at a time. If “none”, the selection will not be changed. Note that the application code and tag bindings can set the selection however they wish, regardless of the value of this option.  
show | A list containing zero or more of the following values, specifying which elements of the tree to display.
  * tree: display tree labels in column #0.
  * headings: display the heading row.

The default is “tree headings”, i.e., show all elements. **Note** : Column #0 always refers to the tree column, even if show=”tree” is not specified.  
### Item Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#item-options "Link to this heading")
The following item options may be specified for items in the insert and item widget commands.
Option | Description  
---|---  
text | The textual label to display for the item.  
image | A Tk Image, displayed to the left of the label.  
values | The list of values associated with the item. Each item should have the same number of values as the widget option columns. If there are fewer values than columns, the remaining values are assumed empty. If there are more values than columns, the extra values are ignored.  
open | `True`/`False` value indicating whether the item’s children should be displayed or hidden.  
tags | A list of tags associated with this item.  
### Tag Options[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tag-options "Link to this heading")
The following options may be specified on tags:
Option | Description  
---|---  
foreground | Specifies the text foreground color.  
background | Specifies the cell or item background color.  
font | Specifies the font to use when drawing text.  
image | Specifies the item image, in case the item’s image option is empty.  
### Column Identifiers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#column-identifiers "Link to this heading")
Column identifiers take any of the following forms:
  * A symbolic name from the list of columns option.
  * An integer n, specifying the nth data column.
  * A string of the form #n, where n is an integer, specifying the nth display column.


Notes:
  * Item’s option values may be displayed in a different order than the order in which they are stored.
  * Column #0 always refers to the tree column, even if show=”tree” is not specified.

Title: Python 2.2 Release Notes - Windows Enhancements
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.2.html
Summary: The document describes several enhancements in Python 2.2 for Windows, including support for Borland C compilation, improved installer solutions from Wise Solutions, and the ability to import `.pyw` files to prevent DOS console outputs. These improvements aim to enhance functionality and usability on the Windows platform.

ters fixing the bug, Michael finding another case, and round and round it went.
  * On Windows, Python can now be compiled with Borland C thanks to a number of patches contributed by Stephen Hansen, though the result isn’t fully functional yet. (But this _is_ progress…)
  * Another Windows enhancement: Wise Solutions generously offered PythonLabs use of their InstallerMaster 8.1 system. Earlier PythonLabs Windows installers used Wise 5.0a, which was beginning to show its age. (Packaged up by Tim Peters.)
  * Files ending in `.pyw` can now be imported on Windows. `.pyw` is a Windows-only thing, used to indicate that a script needs to be run using PYTHONW.EXE instead of PYTHON.EXE in order to prevent a DOS console from popping up to display the output. This patch makes it possible to import such scripts, in case they’re also usable as modules. (Implemented by David Bolen.)
  * On platforms where Python uses the C `dlopen()` function to load extension modules, it’s now possible to set the flags used by `dlopen()` using the [`sys.getdlopenflags()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getdlopenflags "sys.getdlopenflags") and [`sys.setdlopenflags()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setdlopenflags "sys.setdlopenflags") functions. (Contributed by Bram Stolk.)
  * The [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow "pow") built-in function no longer supports 3 arguments when floating-point numbers are supplied. `pow(x, y, z)` returns `(x**y) % z`, but this is never useful for floating-point numbers, and the final result varies unpredictably depending on the platform. A call such as `pow(2.0, 8.0, 7.0)` will now raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception.

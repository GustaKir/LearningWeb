[`tty.cfmakeraw()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tty.html#tty.cfmakeraw "tty.cfmakeraw") and [`tty.cfmakecbreak()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tty.html#tty.cfmakecbreak "tty.cfmakecbreak") now make a copy of the list of special characters before modifying it.
  * [gh-59013](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/59013): Make line number of function breakpoint more precise in [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  * [gh-88434](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88434): Emit deprecation warning for non-integer numbers in [`gettext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services.") functions and methods that consider plural forms even if the translation was not found.
  * [gh-110395](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110395): Ensure that [`select.kqueue()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.kqueue "select.kqueue") objects correctly appear as closed in forked children, to prevent operations on an invalid file descriptor.
  * [gh-110196](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110196): Add `__reduce__` method to `IPv6Address` in order to keep `scope_id`
  * [gh-109747](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109747): Improve errors for unsupported look-behind patterns. Now re.error is raised instead of OverflowError or RuntimeError for too large width of look-behind pattern.
  * [gh-109466](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109466): Add the [`ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped "ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped") property, which returns the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
  * [gh-85098](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85098): Implement the CLI of the [`symtable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/symtable.html#module-symtable "symtable: Interface to the compiler's internal symbol tables.") module and improve the repr of [`Symbol`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/symtable.html#symtable.Symbol "symtable.Symbol").
  * [gh-108791](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108791): Improved error handling in [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") command line interface, making it produce more concise error messages.
  * [gh-105931](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105931): Change [`compileall`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#module-compileall "compileall: Tools for byte-compiling all Python source files in a directory tree.") to only strip the stripdir prefix from the full path recorded in the compiled `.pyc` file, when the prefix matches the start of the full path in its entirety. When the prefix does not match, no stripping is performed and a warning to this effect is displayed.
Previously all path components of the stripdir prefix that matched the full path were removed, while those that did not match were left alone (including ones interspersed between matching components).
  * [gh-107431](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107431): Make the `DictProxy` and `ListProxy` types in [`multiprocessing.managers`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.managers "multiprocessing.managers: Share data between process with shared objects.") [Generic Alias Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-genericalias) for `[]` use in typing contexts.
  * [gh-72904](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/72904): Add [`glob.translate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.translate "glob.translate"). This function converts a pathname with shell-style wildcards to a regular expression.
  * [gh-90026](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90026): Define `USE_XATTRS` on Cygwin so that XATTR-related functions in the [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") module become available.
  * [gh-90890](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90890): New methods [`mailbox.Maildir.get_info()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.get_info "mailbox.Maildir.get_info"), [`mailbox.Maildir.set_info()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.set_info "mailbox.Maildir.set_info"), [`mailbox.Maildir.get_flags()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.get_flags "mailbox.Maildir.get_flags"), [`mailbox.Maildir.set_flags()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.set_flags "mailbox.Maildir.set_flags"), [`mailbox.Maildir.add_flag()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.add_flag "mailbox.Maildir.add_flag"), [`mailbox.Maildir.remove_flag()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir.remove_flag "mailbox.Maildir.remove_flag").

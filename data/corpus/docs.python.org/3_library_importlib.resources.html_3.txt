Title: Changes and Functions in importlib.resources
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html
Summary: This section discusses changes in version 3.13 of the importlib.resources module, specifically the acceptance of multiple _path_names_. It details the is_resource function that checks for the existence of a named resource, returning True if it exists and False otherwise, while noting that directories are not considered resources. Additionally, it introduces the contents function, which returns an iterable of named items within the specified package or path.

Changed in version 3.13: Multiple _path_names_ are accepted. _encoding_ and _errors_ must be given as keyword arguments. 

importlib.resources.is_resource(_anchor_ , _* path_names_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib.resources.is_resource "Link to this definition")
    
Return `True` if the named resource exists, otherwise `False`. This function does not consider directories to be resources.
See [the introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib-resources-functional) for details on _anchor_ and _path_names_.
This function is roughly equivalent to:
```
files(anchor).joinpath(*path_names).is_file()

```

Changed in version 3.13: Multiple _path_names_ are accepted. 

importlib.resources.contents(_anchor_ , _* path_names_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib.resources.contents "Link to this definition")
    
Return an iterable over the named items within the package or path. The iterable returns names of resources (e.g. files) and non-resources (e.g. directories) as [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str"). The iterable does not recurse into subdirectories.
See [the introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib-resources-functional) for details on _anchor_ and _path_names_.
This function is roughly equivalent to:
```
for resource in files(anchor).joinpath(*path_names).iterdir():
  yield resource.name

```

Deprecated since version 3.11: Prefer `iterdir()` as above, which offers more control over the results and richer functionality.

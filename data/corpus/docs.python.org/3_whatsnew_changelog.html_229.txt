Title: Python Changelog Updates
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Recent updates to Python include support for Hyper-V sockets on Windows, improvements to coroutine tracing, porting of warnings to Argument Clinic, and optimizations in the compiler regarding exit blocks. Additionally, a deprecated environment variable for debug builds is now non-functional, and an issue causing hangs during iteration is addressed.

Patch by Ken Jin.
  * [gh-92658](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92658): Add support for connecting and binding to Hyper-V sockets on Windows Hyper-V hosts and guests.
  * [gh-92236](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92236): Remove spurious “LINE” event when starting a generator or coroutine, visible tracing functions implemented in C.
  * [gh-91102](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91102): `_warnings.warn_explicit()` is ported to Argument Clinic.
  * [gh-92619](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92619): Make the compiler duplicate an exit block only if none of its instructions have a lineno (previously only the first instruction in the block was checked, leading to unnecessarily duplicated blocks).
  * [gh-88750](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88750): The deprecated debug build only `PYTHONTHREADDEBUG` environment variable no longer does anything.
  * [gh-92261](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92261): Fix hang when trying to iterate over a `typing.Union`.
  * [gh-91432](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91432): Specialized the [`FOR_ITER`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-FOR_ITER) opcode using the PEP 659 machinery
  * [gh-91399](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91399): Removed duplicate ‘{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}’ entry in ‘Objects/unicodetype_db.h’.
  * [gh-91578](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91578): Updates the error message for abstract class.
  * [bpo-47091](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=47091): Improve performance of repetition of [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") and [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") by using `memcpy` to copy data and performing the reference increments in one step.
  * [bpo-46142](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=46142): Make `--help` output shorter by moving some info to the new `--help-env` and `--help-xoptions` command-line options. Also add `--help-all` option to print complete usage.
  * [bpo-42316](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42316): Document some places where an assignment expression needs parentheses.

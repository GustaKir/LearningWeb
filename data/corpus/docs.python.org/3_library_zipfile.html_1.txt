Title: Zipfile Module Classes Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html
Summary: This documentation chunk covers key classes within the zipfile module, including ZipFile for reading/writing ZIP files, Path for a subset of pathlib.Path interface, PyZipFile for creating ZIP archives of Python libraries, and ZipInfo for representing member information in an archive.
---

_class_ zipfile.ZipFile
    
The class for reading and writing ZIP files. See section [ZipFile Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile-objects) for constructor details. 

_class_ zipfile.Path
    
Class that implements a subset of the interface provided by [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path"), including the full [`importlib.resources.abc.Traversable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.Traversable "importlib.resources.abc.Traversable") interface.
Added in version 3.8. 

_class_ zipfile.PyZipFile
    
Class for creating ZIP archives containing Python libraries. 

_class_ zipfile.ZipInfo(_filename ='NoName'_, _date_time =(1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "Link to this definition")
    
Class used to represent information about a member of an archive. Instances of this class are returned by the [`getinfo()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.getinfo "zipfile.ZipFile.getinfo") and [`infolist()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.infolist "zipfile.ZipFile.infolist") methods of [`ZipFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile "zipfile.ZipFile") objects. Most users of the [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") module will not need to create these, but only use those created by this module. _filename_ should be the full name of the archive member, and _date_time_ should be a tuple containing six fields which describe the time of the last modification to the file; the fields are described in section [ZipInfo Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipinfo-objects).
Changed in version 3.13: A public `compress_level` attribute has been added to expose the formerly protected `_compresslevel`. The older protected name continues to work as a property for backwards compatibility. 

zipfile.is_zipfile(_filename_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.is_zipfile "Link to this definition")
    
Returns `True` if _filename_ is a valid ZIP file based on its magic number, otherwise returns `False`. _filename_ may be a file or file-like object too.
Changed in version 3.1: Support for file and file-like objects. 

zipfile.ZIP_STORED[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_STORED "Link to this definition")
    
The numeric constant for an uncompressed archive member. 

zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED "Link to this definition")
    
The numeric constant for the usual ZIP compression method. This requires the [`zlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") module. 

zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2 "Link to this definition")
    
The numeric constant for the BZIP2 compression method. This requires the [`bz2`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#module-bz2 "bz2: Interfaces for bzip2 compression and decompression.") module.
Added in version 3.3. 

zipfile.ZIP_LZMA[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZIP_LZMA "Link to this definition")
    
The numeric constant for the LZMA compression method. This requires the [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library.") module.
Added in version 3.3.
Note
The ZIP file format specification has included support for bzip2 compression since 2001, and for LZMA compression since 2006. However, some tools (including older Python releases) do not support these compression methods, and may either refuse to process the ZIP file altogether, or fail to extract individual files.

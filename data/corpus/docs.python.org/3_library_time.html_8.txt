Title: Time Module - Timezone Support and Struct Time
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
Summary: This section explains the platform-specific support of the `%Z` directive in time handling, which relies on `tzname` values and daylight status. It notes that while `strftime()` may offer additional directives based on the platform, `strptime()` does not guarantee support for non-documented directives. It also introduces the `time.struct_time` class, which is the return type for functions like `gmtime()`, `localtime()`, and `strptime()`.
---

```

Support for the `%Z` directive is based on the values contained in `tzname` and whether `daylight` is true. Because of this, it is platform-specific except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to be non-daylight savings timezones).
Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported. Because `strftime()` is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more directives than those listed. But `strptime()` is independent of any platform and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not documented as supported. 

_class_ time.struct_time[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "Link to this definition")
    
The type of the time value sequence returned by [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime"), [`localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime"), and [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime"). It is an object with a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) interface: values can be accessed by index and by attribute name. The following values are present:
Index | Attribute | Values  
---|---|---  
0 |  

tm_year[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_year "Link to this definition")
| (for example, 1993)  
1 |  

tm_mon[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_mon "Link to this definition")
| range [1, 12]  
2 |  

tm_mday[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_mday "Link to this definition")
| range [1, 31]  
3 |  

tm_hour[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_hour "Link to this definition")
| range [0, 23]  
4 |  

tm_min[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_min "Link to this definition")
| range [0, 59]  
5 |  

tm_sec[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_sec "Link to this definition")
| range [0, 61]; see [Note (2)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#leap-second) in [`strftime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime "time.strftime")  
6 |  

tm_wday[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_wday "Link to this definition")
| range [0, 6]; Monday is 0  
7 |  

tm_yday[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_yday "Link to this definition")
| range [1, 366]  
8 |  

tm_isdst[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_isdst "Link to this definition")
| 0, 1 or -1; see below  
N/A |  

tm_zone[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_zone "Link to this definition")
| abbreviation of timezone name  
N/A |  

tm_gmtoff[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_gmtoff "Link to this definition")
| offset east of UTC in seconds  
Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not [0, 11].
In calls to [`mktime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime "time.mktime"), [`tm_isdst`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_isdst "time.struct_time.tm_isdst") may be set to 1 when daylight savings time is in effect, and 0 when it is not. A value of -1 indicates that this is not known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in.
When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time"), or having elements of the wrong type, a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.

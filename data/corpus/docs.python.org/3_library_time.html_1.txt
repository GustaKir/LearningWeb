Title: Understanding Time Functions and DST in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
Summary: This section discusses Daylight Saving Time (DST), highlighting its dependency on local laws and variability. It explains that the precision of real-time functions may be less than indicated, especially on Unix systems, where the clock ticks at limited intervals. Additionally, it notes that Python's `time()` and `sleep()` functions offer better precision than their Unix counterparts.

* DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one hour during part of the year. DST rules are magic (determined by local law) and can change from year to year. The C library has a table containing the local rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the only source of True Wisdom in this respect.
  * The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested by the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most Unix systems, the clock “ticks” only 50 or 100 times a second.
  * On the other hand, the precision of [`time()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time "time.time") and [`sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep "time.sleep") is better than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating-point numbers, [`time()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time "time.time") returns the most accurate time available (using Unix `gettimeofday()` where available), and [`sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep "time.sleep") will accept a time with a nonzero fraction (Unix `select()` is used to implement this, where available).
  * The time value as returned by [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime"), [`localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime"), and [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime"), and accepted by [`asctime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.asctime "time.asctime"), [`mktime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime "time.mktime") and [`strftime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime "time.strftime"), is a sequence of 9 integers. The return values of [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime"), [`localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime"), and [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strptime "time.strptime") also offer attribute names for individual fields.
See [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") for a description of these objects.
Changed in version 3.3: The [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") type was extended to provide the [`tm_gmtoff`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_gmtoff "time.struct_time.tm_gmtoff") and [`tm_zone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_zone "time.struct_time.tm_zone") attributes when platform supports corresponding `struct tm` members.
Changed in version 3.6: The [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") attributes [`tm_gmtoff`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_gmtoff "time.struct_time.tm_gmtoff") and [`tm_zone`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time.tm_zone "time.struct_time.tm_zone") are now available on all platforms.
  * Use the following functions to convert between time representations:
From | To | Use  
---|---|---  
seconds since the epoch | [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") in UTC | [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime")  
seconds since the epoch | [`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") in local time | [`localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.localtime "time.localtime")  
[`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") in UTC | seconds since the epoch | [`calendar.timegm()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.timegm "calendar.timegm")  
[`struct_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.struct_time "time.struct_time") in local time | seconds since the epoch | [`mktime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime "time.mktime")

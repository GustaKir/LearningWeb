Title: StreamReaderWriter Class in Codecs Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html
Summary: The `codecs.StreamReaderWriter` class creates an instance that combines the functionalities of `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` for file-like objects. It requires appropriate Reader and Writer factory functions or classes and handles errors as specified for stream readers and writers.

_class_ codecs.StreamReaderWriter(_stream_ , _Reader_ , _Writer_ , _errors ='strict'_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamReaderWriter "Link to this definition")
    
Creates a [`StreamReaderWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamReaderWriter "codecs.StreamReaderWriter") instance. _stream_ must be a file-like object. _Reader_ and _Writer_ must be factory functions or classes providing the [`StreamReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamReader "codecs.StreamReader") and [`StreamWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamWriter "codecs.StreamWriter") interface resp. Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers.
[`StreamReaderWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamReaderWriter "codecs.StreamReaderWriter") instances define the combined interfaces of [`StreamReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamReader "codecs.StreamReader") and [`StreamWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamWriter "codecs.StreamWriter") classes. They inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream.
#### StreamRecoder Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#streamrecoder-objects "Link to this heading")
The [`StreamRecoder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamRecoder "codecs.StreamRecoder") translates data from one encoding to another, which is sometimes useful when dealing with different encoding environments.
The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the [`lookup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.lookup "codecs.lookup") function to construct the instance.

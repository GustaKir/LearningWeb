### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id696 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-20640](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20640): Add tests for idlelib.configHelpSourceEdit. Patch by Saimadhav Heblikar.
  * In the ‘IDLE-console differences’ section of the IDLE doc, clarify how running with IDLE affects sys.modules and the standard streams.
  * [bpo-25507](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25507): fix incorrect change in IOBinding that prevented printing. Augment IOBinding htest to include all major IOBinding functions.
  * [bpo-25905](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25905): Revert unwanted conversion of ‘ to ’ RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK in README.txt and open this and NEWS.txt with ‘ascii’. Re-encode CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with ‘utf-8’.
  * [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
  * [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow any existing interaction to terminate first.
  * Change ‘The program’ to ‘Your program’ in an IDLE ‘kill program?’ message to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running user program, not IDLE itself.
  * [bpo-24750](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24750): Improve the appearance of the IDLE editor window status bar. Patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-25313](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25313): Change the handling of new built-in text color themes to better address the compatibility problem introduced by the addition of IDLE Dark. Consistently use the revised idleConf.CurrentTheme everywhere in idlelib.
  * [bpo-24782](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24782): Extension configuration is now a tab in the IDLE Preferences dialog rather than a separate dialog. The former tabs are now a sorted list. Patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-22726](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22726): Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
  * [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): IDLE now has an ‘IDLE Dark’ built-in text color theme. It is more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background. Strings, comments, keywords, … are still green, red, orange, … . To use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the ‘Save as New Custom Theme’ button and enter a new name, such as ‘Custom Dark’. The custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
  * [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter. ‘IDLE’ now means ‘Integrated Development and Learning Environment’.
  * [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-24972](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24972): Inactive selection background now matches active selection background, as configured by users, on all systems. Found items are now always highlighted on Windows. Initial patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-24570](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24570): Idle: make calltip and completion boxes appear on Macs affected by a tk regression. Initial patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-24988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24988): Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger) now work on Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-24801](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24801): Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.
  * [bpo-25173](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25173): Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget. For Mac OSX, make them a ‘sheet’. Patch by Mark Roseman.

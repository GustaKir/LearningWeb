URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section outlines various updates related to the build process in Python, including changes to BOLT configuration, enhancements to MSBuild properties for Windows, fixes for ClangCL compatibility, and deprecation of the `ma_version_tag` field in `PyDictObject`, as per PEP 699, which will be removed in Python 3.14.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id175 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-101282](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101282): Update BOLT configuration not to use deprecated usage of `--split functions`. Patch by Donghee Na.
  * [gh-101522](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101522): Allow overriding Windows dependencies versions and paths using MSBuild properties.
  * [gh-77532](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77532): Minor fixes to allow building with `PlatformToolset=ClangCL` on Windows.
  * [gh-101152](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101152): In accordance with [**PEP 699**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0699/), the `ma_version_tag` field in [`PyDictObject`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/dict.html#c.PyDictObject "PyDictObject") is deprecated for extension modules. Accessing this field will generate a compiler warning at compile time. This field will be removed in Python 3.14.
  * [gh-100340](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100340): Allows -Wno-int-conversion for wasm-sdk 17 and onwards, thus enables building WASI builds once against the latest sdk.
  * [gh-101060](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101060): Conditionally add `-fno-reorder-blocks-and-partition` in configure. Effectively fixes `--enable-bolt` when using Clang, as this appears to be a GCC-only flag.
  * [gh-98705](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98705): `__bool__` is defined in AIX system header files which breaks the build in AIX, so undefine it.
  * [gh-98636](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98636): Fix a regression in detecting `gdbm_compat` library for the `_gdbm` module build.
  * [gh-96305](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96305): `_aix_support` now uses a simple code to get platform details rather than the now non-existent `_bootsubprocess` during bootstrap.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id176 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-101543](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101543): Ensure the install path in the registry is only used when the standard library hasn’t been located in any other way.
  * [gh-101467](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101467): The `py.exe` launcher now correctly filters when only a single runtime is installed. It also correctly handles prefix matches on tags so that `-3.1` does not match `3.11`, but would still match `3.1-32`.
  * [gh-99834](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99834): Updates bundled copy of Tcl/Tk to 8.6.13.0
  * [gh-101135](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101135): Restore ability to launch older 32-bit versions from the `py.exe` launcher when both 32-bit and 64-bit installs of the same version are available.
  * [gh-82052](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82052): Fixed an issue where writing more than 32K of Unicode output to the console screen in one go can result in mojibake.
  * [gh-100320](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100320): Ensures the `PythonPath` registry key from an install is used when launching from a different copy of Python that relies on an existing install to provide a copy of its modules and standard library.
  * [gh-100247](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100247): Restores support for the `py.exe` launcher finding shebang commands in its configuration file using the full command name.

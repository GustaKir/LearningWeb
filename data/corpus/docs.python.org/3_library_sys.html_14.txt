Title: sys Module: Asynchronous Generator Hooks
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
Summary: The sys.get_asyncgen_hooks() function returns an _asyncgen_hooks_ object, consisting of a tuple containing functions for the first iterator and finalization of asynchronous generators. It was introduced in Python 3.6 as part of PEP 525 and is provisional as per PEP 411.

sys.get_asyncgen_hooks()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.get_asyncgen_hooks "Link to this definition")
    
Returns an _asyncgen_hooks_ object, which is similar to a [`namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple") of the form `(firstiter, finalizer)`, where _firstiter_ and _finalizer_ are expected to be either `None` or functions which take an [asynchronous generator iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-generator-iterator) as an argument, and are used to schedule finalization of an asynchronous generator by an event loop.
Added in version 3.6: See [**PEP 525**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0525/) for more details.
Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/) for details.) 

sys.get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth "Link to this definition")
    
Get the current coroutine origin tracking depth, as set by [`set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth "sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth").
Added in version 3.7.
Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/) for details.) Use it only for debugging purposes. 

sys.hash_info[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info "Link to this definition")
    
A [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) giving parameters of the numeric hash implementation. For more details about hashing of numeric types, see [Hashing of numeric types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-hash). 

hash_info.width[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.width "Link to this definition")
    
The width in bits used for hash values 

hash_info.modulus[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.modulus "Link to this definition")
    
The prime modulus P used for numeric hash scheme 

hash_info.inf[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.inf "Link to this definition")
    
The hash value returned for a positive infinity 

hash_info.nan[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.nan "Link to this definition")
    
(This attribute is no longer used) 

hash_info.imag[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.imag "Link to this definition")
    
The multiplier used for the imaginary part of a complex number 

hash_info.algorithm[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.algorithm "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the algorithm for hashing of str, bytes, and memoryview 

hash_info.hash_bits[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.hash_bits "Link to this definition")
    
The internal output size of the hash algorithm 

hash_info.seed_bits[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hash_info.seed_bits "Link to this definition")
    
The size of the seed key of the hash algorithm
Added in version 3.2.
Changed in version 3.4: Added _algorithm_ , _hash_bits_ and _seed_bits_ 

sys.hexversion[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.hexversion "Link to this definition")
    
The version number encoded as a single integer. This is guaranteed to increase with each version, including proper support for non-production releases. For example, to test that the Python interpreter is at least version 1.5.2, use:
```
if sys.hexversion >= 0x010502F0:
  # use some advanced feature
  ...
else:
  # use an alternative implementation or warn the user
  ...

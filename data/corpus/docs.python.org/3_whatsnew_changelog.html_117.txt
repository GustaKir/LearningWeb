### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id118 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-113666](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113666): Add the following constants to module [`stat`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stat.html#module-stat "stat: Utilities for interpreting the results of os.stat\(\), os.lstat\(\) and os.fstat\(\)."): `UF_SETTABLE`, `UF_TRACKED`, `UF_DATAVAULT`, `SF_SUPPORTED`, `SF_SETTABLE`, `SF_SYNTHETIC`, `SF_RESTRICTED`, `SF_FIRMLINK` and `SF_DATALESS`. The values `UF_SETTABLE`, `SF_SUPPORTED`, `SF_SETTABLE` and `SF_SYNTHETIC` are only available on macOS.
  * [gh-113536](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113536): [`os.waitid()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.waitid "os.waitid") is now available on macOS
  * [gh-110459](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110459): Running `configure ... --with-openssl-rpath=X/Y/Z` no longer fails to detect OpenSSL on macOS.
  * [gh-74573](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74573): Document that [`dbm.ndbm`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html#module-dbm.ndbm "dbm.ndbm: The New Database Manager \(Unix\)") can silently corrupt DBM files on updates when exceeding undocumented platform limits, and can crash (segmentation fault) when reading such a corrupted file. (FB8919203)
  * [gh-65701](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/65701): The **freeze** tool doesn’t work with framework builds of Python. Document this and bail out early when running the tool with such a build.
  * [gh-87277](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87277): webbrowser: Don’t look for X11 browsers on macOS. Those are generally not used and probing for them can result in starting XQuartz even if it isn’t used otherwise.
  * [gh-111973](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111973): Update macOS installer to use SQLite 3.44.2.
  * [gh-108269](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108269): Set `CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations` to true in the Info.plist for the framework, embedded Python.app and IDLE.app with framework installs on macOS. This allows applications to pick up the user’s preferred locale when that’s different from english.
  * [gh-102362](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102362): Make sure the result of `sysconfig.get_plaform()` includes at least a major and minor versions, even if `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is set to only a major version during build to match the format expected by pip.
  * [gh-110017](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110017): Disable a signal handling stress test on macOS due to a bug in macOS (FB13453490).
  * [gh-110820](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110820): Make sure the preprocessor definitions for `ALIGNOF_MAX_ALIGN_T`, `SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE` and `HAVE_GCC_ASM_FOR_X64` are correct for Universal 2 builds on macOS.
  * [gh-109981](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109981): Use `/dev/fd` on macOS to determine the number of open files in `test.support.os_helper.fd_count` to avoid a crash with “guarded” file descriptors when probing for open files.


### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id119 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-72284](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/72284): Improve the lists of features, editor key bindings, and shell key bingings in the IDLE doc.
  * [gh-113903](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113903): Fix rare failure of test.test_idle, in test_configdialog.
  * [gh-113729](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113729): Fix the “Help -> IDLE Doc” menu bug in 3.11.7 and 3.12.1.
  * [gh-113269](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113269): Fix test_editor hang on macOS Catalina.
  * [gh-112898](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112898): Fix processing unsaved files when quitting IDLE on macOS.
  * [bpo-13586](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13586): Enter the selected text when opening the “Replace” dialog.

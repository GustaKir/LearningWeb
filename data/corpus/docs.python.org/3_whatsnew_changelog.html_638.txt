### IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id600 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-32207](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32207): Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE. When tk event handling is driven by IDLE’s run loop, a confusing and distracting queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added to tk event exception tracebacks. The traceback is now the same as when event handling is driven by user code. Patch based on a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.
  * [bpo-32164](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32164): Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py. Use of TabbedPageSet in configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.
  * [bpo-32100](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32100): IDLE: Fix old and new bugs in pathbrowser; improve tests. Patch mostly by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31858](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31858): IDLE – Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell. Editor and output windows only see an empty last prompt line. This simplifies the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted. Sys.ps1, if present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.
  * [bpo-31860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31860): The font sample in the IDLE configuration dialog is now editable. Changes persist while IDLE remains open
  * [bpo-31836](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31836): Test_code_module now passes if run after test_idle, which sets ps1. The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to ‘>>> ‘ if not. Test_code_module now properly tests both behaviors. Ditto for ps2.
  * [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28603): Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane Bitter.
  * [bpo-13802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13802): Use non-Latin characters in the IDLE’s Font settings sample. Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a better idea of what they might see in IDLE’s shell and editors. To make room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are re-arranged. The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
  * [bpo-31460](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31460): Simplify the API of IDLE’s Module Browser. Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window. Passing a full file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.
  * [bpo-31649](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31649): IDLE - Make _htest, _utest parameters keyword only.
  * [bpo-31559](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31559): Remove test order dependence in idle_test.test_browser.
  * [bpo-31459](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31459): Rename IDLE’s module browser from Class Browser to Module Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago. Nested classes and functions were added yesterday. For back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
  * [bpo-31500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31500): Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
  * [bpo-1612262](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1612262): IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions. Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and Cheryl Sabella, respectively.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id601 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-30722](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30722): Make redemo work with Python 3.6 and newer versions. Also, remove the `LOCALE` option since it doesn’t work with string patterns in Python 3. Patch by Christoph Sarnowski.

Title: Ctypes - C Data Types
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html
Summary: This section of the ctypes documentation describes various C data types available in Python's ctypes library, including c_double, c_longdouble, c_float, and c_int. Each datatype class can be initialized with an optional float or integer value.
---

_class_ ctypes.c_double[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_double "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C double datatype. The constructor accepts an optional float initializer. 

_class_ ctypes.c_longdouble[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longdouble "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C longdouble datatype. The constructor accepts an optional float initializer. On platforms where `sizeof(long double) == sizeof(double)` it is an alias to [`c_double`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_double "ctypes.c_double"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_float[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_float "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C float datatype. The constructor accepts an optional float initializer. 

_class_ ctypes.c_int[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C signedint datatype. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. On platforms where `sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)` it is an alias to [`c_long`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_long "ctypes.c_long"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_int8[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int8 "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C 8-bit signedint datatype. Usually an alias for [`c_byte`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_byte "ctypes.c_byte"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_int16[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int16 "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C 16-bit signedint datatype. Usually an alias for [`c_short`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_short "ctypes.c_short"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_int32[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int32 "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C 32-bit signedint datatype. Usually an alias for [`c_int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int "ctypes.c_int"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_int64[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_int64 "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C 64-bit signedint datatype. Usually an alias for [`c_longlong`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longlong "ctypes.c_longlong"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_long[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_long "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C signedlong datatype. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. 

_class_ ctypes.c_longlong[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longlong "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C signedlonglong datatype. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. 

_class_ ctypes.c_short[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_short "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C signedshort datatype. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. 

_class_ ctypes.c_size_t[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_size_t "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C `size_t` datatype. 

_class_ ctypes.c_ssize_t[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_ssize_t "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C `ssize_t` datatype.
Added in version 3.2. 

_class_ ctypes.c_time_t[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_time_t "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C `time_t` datatype.
Added in version 3.12. 

_class_ ctypes.c_ubyte[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_ubyte "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C unsignedchar datatype, it interprets the value as small integer. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. 

_class_ ctypes.c_uint[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_uint "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C unsignedint datatype. The constructor accepts an optional integer initializer; no overflow checking is done. On platforms where `sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)` it is an alias for [`c_ulong`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_ulong "ctypes.c_ulong"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_uint8[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_uint8 "Link to this definition")
    
Represents the C 8-bit unsignedint datatype. Usually an alias for [`c_ubyte`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_ubyte "ctypes.c_ubyte"). 

_class_ ctypes.c_uint16[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_uint16 "Link to this definition")

This is used to communicate with services, such as GPS or radio, running on Qualcomm devices. Patch by Bjorn Andersson.
  * [bpo-22005](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22005): Implemented unpickling instances of [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime"), [`date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date "datetime.date") and [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time "datetime.time") pickled by Python 2. `encoding='latin1'` should be used for successful decoding.
  * [bpo-27645](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27645): [`sqlite3.Connection`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection "sqlite3.Connection") now exposes a [`backup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.backup "sqlite3.Connection.backup") method, if the underlying SQLite library is at version 3.6.11 or higher. Patch by Lele Gaifax.
  * [bpo-16865](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16865): Support arrays >=2GiB in [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."). Patch by Segev Finer.
  * [bpo-31508](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31508): Removed support of arguments in `tkinter.ttk.Treeview.selection`. It was deprecated in 3.6. Use specialized methods like `selection_set` for changing the selection.
  * [bpo-29456](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29456): Fix bugs in hangul normalization: u1176, u11a7 and u11c3

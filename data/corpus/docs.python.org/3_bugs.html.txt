# Dealing with Bugs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#dealing-with-bugs "Link to this heading")
Python is a mature programming language which has established a reputation for stability. In order to maintain this reputation, the developers would like to know of any deficiencies you find in Python.
It can be sometimes faster to fix bugs yourself and contribute patches to Python as it streamlines the process and involves less people. Learn how to [contribute](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#contributing-to-python).
## Documentation bugs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#documentation-bugs "Link to this heading")
If you find a bug in this documentation or would like to propose an improvement, please submit a bug report on the [tracker](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#using-the-tracker). If you have a suggestion on how to fix it, include that as well.
You can also open a discussion item on our [Documentation Discourse forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/documentation/26).
If you find a bug in the theme (HTML / CSS / JavaScript) of the documentation, please submit a bug report on the [python-doc-theme bug tracker](https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme).
If you’re short on time, you can also email documentation bug reports to docs@python.org (behavioral bugs can be sent to python-list@python.org). ‘docs@’ is a mailing list run by volunteers; your request will be noticed, though it may take a while to be processed.

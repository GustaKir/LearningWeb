Title: Mailbox.MMDF Class
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html
Summary: The `MMDF` class is a subclass of `Mailbox` specifically for handling mailboxes in MMDF format. It allows for a custom message representation through a callable factory and can create the mailbox if it does not exist. MMDF is a single-file format designed for the Multichannel Memorandum Distribution Facility, with messages enclosed by Control-A characters.

_class_ mailbox.MMDF(_path_ , _factory =None_, _create =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDF "Link to this definition")
    
A subclass of [`Mailbox`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Mailbox "mailbox.Mailbox") for mailboxes in MMDF format. Parameter _factory_ is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation (which behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation. If _factory_ is `None`, [`MMDFMessage`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDFMessage "mailbox.MMDFMessage") is used as the default message representation. If _create_ is `True`, the mailbox is created if it does not exist.
MMDF is a single-file mailbox format invented for the Multichannel Memorandum Distribution Facility, a mail transfer agent. Each message is in the same form as an mbox message but is bracketed before and after by lines containing four Control-A (`'\001'`) characters. As with the mbox format, the beginning of each message is indicated by a line whose first five characters are “From “, but additional occurrences of “From “ are not transformed to “>From “ when storing messages because the extra message separator lines prevent mistaking such occurrences for the starts of subsequent messages.
Some [`Mailbox`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Mailbox "mailbox.Mailbox") methods implemented by `MMDF` deserve special remarks: 

get_bytes(_key_ , _from_ =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDF.get_bytes "Link to this definition")
    
Note: This method has an extra parameter (_from__) compared with other classes. The first line of an mbox file entry is the Unix “From “ line. If _from__ is False, the first line of the file is dropped. 

get_file(_key_ , _from_ =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDF.get_file "Link to this definition")
    
Using the file after calling [`flush()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Mailbox.flush "mailbox.Mailbox.flush") or [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Mailbox.close "mailbox.Mailbox.close") on the `MMDF` instance may yield unpredictable results or raise an exception.
Note: This method has an extra parameter (_from__) compared with other classes. The first line of an mbox file entry is the Unix “From “ line. If _from__ is False, the first line of the file is dropped. 

lock()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDF.lock "Link to this definition")


unlock()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.MMDF.unlock "Link to this definition")
    
Three locking mechanisms are used—dot locking and, if available, the `flock()` and `lockf()` system calls.

### hmac[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#hmac "Link to this heading")
The [`hmac`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#module-hmac "hmac: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication \(HMAC\) implementation") module now has an optimized one-shot [`digest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#hmac.digest "hmac.digest") function, which is up to three times faster than `HMAC()`. (Contributed by Christian Heimes in [bpo-32433](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32433).)
### http.client[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#http-client "Link to this heading")
[`HTTPConnection`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection "http.client.HTTPConnection") and [`HTTPSConnection`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPSConnection "http.client.HTTPSConnection") now support the new _blocksize_ argument for improved upload throughput. (Contributed by Nir Soffer in [bpo-31945](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31945).)
### http.server[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#http-server "Link to this heading")
[`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler "http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler") now supports the HTTP `If-Modified-Since` header. The server returns the 304 response status if the target file was not modified after the time specified in the header. (Contributed by Pierre Quentel in [bpo-29654](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29654).)
[`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler "http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler") accepts the new _directory_ argument, in addition to the new `--directory` command line argument. With this parameter, the server serves the specified directory, by default it uses the current working directory. (Contributed by Stéphane Wirtel and Julien Palard in [bpo-28707](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28707).)
The new [`ThreadingHTTPServer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer "http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer") class uses threads to handle requests using `ThreadingMixin`. It is used when `http.server` is run with `-m`. (Contributed by Julien Palard in [bpo-31639](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31639).)
### idlelib and IDLE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#idlelib-and-idle "Link to this heading")
Multiple fixes for autocompletion. (Contributed by Louie Lu in [bpo-15786](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15786).)
Module Browser (on the File menu, formerly called Class Browser), now displays nested functions and classes in addition to top-level functions and classes. (Contributed by Guilherme Polo, Cheryl Sabella, and Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-1612262](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1612262).)
The Settings dialog (Options, Configure IDLE) has been partly rewritten to improve both appearance and function. (Contributed by Cheryl Sabella and Terry Jan Reedy in multiple issues.)
The font sample now includes a selection of non-Latin characters so that users can better see the effect of selecting a particular font. (Contributed by Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-13802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13802).) The sample can be edited to include other characters. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-31860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31860).)
The IDLE features formerly implemented as extensions have been reimplemented as normal features. Their settings have been moved from the Extensions tab to other dialog tabs. (Contributed by Charles Wohlganger and Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-27099](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27099).)
Editor code context option revised. Box displays all context lines up to maxlines. Clicking on a context line jumps the editor to that line. Context colors for custom themes is added to Highlights tab of Settings dialog. (Contributed by Cheryl Sabella and Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-33642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33642), [bpo-33768](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33768), and [bpo-33679](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33679).)
On Windows, a new API call tells Windows that tk scales for DPI. On Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python binary unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this should make text and lines sharper. It should otherwise have no effect. (Contributed by Terry Jan Reedy in [bpo-33656](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33656).)
New in 3.7.1:
Output over N lines (50 by default) is squeezed down to a button.

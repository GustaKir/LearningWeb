URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html
Summary: This section details the attributes of the `TracebackException` class, including `stack`, `exc_type`, `exc_type_str`, `filename`, and `lineno`. It highlights that `exc_type` is deprecated since version 3.13, while `exc_type_str` was introduced in the same version.
---

stack[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.stack "Link to this definition")
    
A [`StackSummary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary "traceback.StackSummary") representing the traceback. 

exc_type[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.exc_type "Link to this definition")
    
The class of the original traceback.
Deprecated since version 3.13. 

exc_type_str[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.exc_type_str "Link to this definition")
    
String display of the class of the original exception.
Added in version 3.13. 

filename[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.filename "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the file name where the error occurred. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the line number where the error occurred. 

end_lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.end_lineno "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the end line number where the error occurred. Can be `None` if not present.
Added in version 3.10. 

text[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.text "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the text where the error occurred. 

offset[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.offset "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the offset into the text where the error occurred. 

end_offset[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.end_offset "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the end offset into the text where the error occurred. Can be `None` if not present.
Added in version 3.10. 

msg[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.msg "Link to this definition")
    
For syntax errors - the compiler error message. 

_classmethod_ from_exception(_exc_ , _*_ , _limit =None_, _lookup_lines =True_, _capture_locals =False_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.from_exception "Link to this definition")
    
Capture an exception for later rendering. _limit_ , _lookup_lines_ and _capture_locals_ are as for the [`StackSummary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.StackSummary "traceback.StackSummary") class.
Note that when locals are captured, they are also shown in the traceback. 

print(_*_ , _file =None_, _chain =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.print "Link to this definition")
    
Print to _file_ (default `sys.stderr`) the exception information returned by [`format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format").
Added in version 3.11. 

format(_*_ , _chain =True_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.format "Link to this definition")
    
Format the exception.
If _chain_ is not `True`, [`__cause__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.__cause__ "traceback.TracebackException.__cause__") and [`__context__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.TracebackException.__context__ "traceback.TracebackException.__context__") will not be formatted.
The return value is a generator of strings, each ending in a newline and some containing internal newlines. [`print_exception()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.print_exception "traceback.print_exception") is a wrapper around this method which just prints the lines to a file.

### Tests[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id698 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-21916](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21916): Added tests for the turtle module. Patch by ingrid, Gregory Loyse and Jelle Zijlstra.
  * [bpo-26295](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26295): When using “python3 -m test –testdir=TESTDIR”, regrtest doesn’t add “test.” prefix to test module names.
  * [bpo-26523](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26523): The multiprocessing thread pool (multiprocessing.dummy.Pool) was untested.
  * [bpo-26015](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26015): Added new tests for pickling iterators of mutable sequences.
  * [bpo-26325](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26325): Added test.support.check_no_resource_warning() to check that no ResourceWarning is emitted.
  * [bpo-25940](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25940): Changed test_ssl to use its internal local server more. This avoids relying on svn.python.org, which recently changed root certificate.
  * [bpo-25616](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25616): Tests for OrderedDict are extracted from test_collections into separate file test_ordered_dict.
  * [bpo-25449](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25449): Added tests for OrderedDict subclasses.
  * [bpo-25188](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25188): Add -P/–pgo to test.regrtest to suppress error output when running the test suite for the purposes of a PGO build. Initial patch by Alecsandru Patrascu.
  * [bpo-22806](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22806): Add `python -m test --list-tests` command to list tests.
  * [bpo-18174](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18174): `python -m test --huntrleaks ...` now also checks for leak of file descriptors. Patch written by Richard Oudkerk.
  * [bpo-25260](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25260): Fix `python -m test --coverage` on Windows. Remove the list of ignored directories.
  * `PCbuild\rt.bat` now accepts an unlimited number of arguments to pass along to regrtest.py. Previously there was a limit of 9.
  * [bpo-26583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26583): Skip test_timestamp_overflow in test_import if bytecode files cannot be written.

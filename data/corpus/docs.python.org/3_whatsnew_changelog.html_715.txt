### Library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id730 "Link to this heading")
  * [bpo-21386](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21386): Implement missing IPv4Address.is_global property. It was documented since 07a5610bae9d. Initial patch by Roger Luethi.
  * [bpo-20900](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20900): distutils register command now decodes HTTP responses correctly. Initial patch by ingrid.
  * A new version of typing.py provides several new classes and features: @overload outside stubs, Reversible, DefaultDict, Text, ContextManager, Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug fixes (note that some of the new features are not yet implemented in mypy or other static analyzers). Also classes for [**PEP 492**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/) (Awaitable, AsyncIterable, AsyncIterator) have been added (in fact they made it into 3.5.1 but were never mentioned).
  * [bpo-25738](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25738): Stop http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.send_error() from sending a message body for 205 Reset Content. Also, don’t send Content header fields in responses that don’t have a body. Patch by Susumu Koshiba.
  * [bpo-21313](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21313): Fix the “platform” module to tolerate when sys.version contains truncated build information.
  * [bpo-27164](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27164): In the zlib module, allow decompressing raw Deflate streams with a predefined zdict. Based on patch by Xiang Zhang.
  * [bpo-24291](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24291): Fix wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler to completely write data to the client. Previously it could do partial writes and truncate data. Also, wsgiref.handler.ServerHandler can now handle stdout doing partial writes, but this is deprecated.
  * [bpo-26809](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26809): Add `__all__` to [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations."). Patch by Emanuel Barry.
  * [bpo-26373](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26373): subprocess.Popen.communicate now correctly ignores BrokenPipeError when the child process dies before .communicate() is called in more/all circumstances.
  * [bpo-21776](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21776): distutils.upload now correctly handles HTTPError. Initial patch by Claudiu Popa.
  * [bpo-27114](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27114): Fix SSLContext._load_windows_store_certs fails with PermissionError
  * [bpo-18383](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18383): Avoid creating duplicate filters when using filterwarnings and simplefilter. Based on patch by Alex Shkop.
  * [bpo-27057](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27057): Fix os.set_inheritable() on Android, ioctl() is blocked by SELinux and fails with EACCESS. The function now falls back to fcntl(). Patch written by Michał Bednarski.
  * [bpo-27014](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27014): Fix infinite recursion using typing.py. Thanks to Kalle Tuure!
  * [bpo-14132](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=14132): Fix urllib.request redirect handling when the target only has a query string. Original fix by Ján Janech.
  * [bpo-17214](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17214): The “urllib.request” module now percent-encodes non-ASCII bytes found in redirect target URLs. Some servers send Location header fields with non-ASCII bytes, but “http.client” requires the request target to be ASCII-encodable, otherwise a UnicodeEncodeError is raised. Based on patch by Christian Heimes.
  * [bpo-26892](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26892): Honor debuglevel flag in urllib.request.HTTPHandler. Patch contributed by Chi Hsuan Yen.
  * [bpo-22274](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22274): In the subprocess module, allow stderr to be redirected to stdout even when stdout is not redirected. Patch by Akira Li.
  * [bpo-26807](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26807): mock_open ‘files’ no longer error on readline at end of file. Patch from Yolanda Robla.

  * [bpo-26977](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26977): Removed unnecessary, and ignored, call to sum of squares helper in statistics.pvariance.
  * [bpo-26881](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26881): The modulefinder module now supports extended opcode arguments.
  * [bpo-23815](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23815): Fixed crashes related to directly created instances of types in _tkinter and curses.panel modules.
  * [bpo-17765](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17765): weakref.ref() no longer

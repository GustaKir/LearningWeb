Title: Calendar Module Overview
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
Summary: The calendar module provides functions for calendar-related tasks, including `timegm()`, which serves as the inverse of `gmtime()` from the time module. It notes deprecations and changes in date formatting standards.

Module [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program.")
    
General calendar-related functions. [`timegm()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.timegm "calendar.timegm") is the inverse of [`gmtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.gmtime "time.gmtime") from this module.

The use of `%Z` is now deprecated, but the `%z` escape that expands to the preferred hour/minute offset is not supported by all ANSI C libraries. Also, a strict reading of the original 1982 [**RFC 822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822.html) standard calls for a two-digit year (`%y` rather than `%Y`), but practice moved to 4-digit years long before the year 2000. After that, [**RFC 822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822.html) became obsolete and the 4-digit year has been first recommended by [**RFC 1123**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123.html) and then mandated by [**RFC 2822**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html).

Title: Porting to Python 2.4
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.4.html
Summary: This section outlines important changes in Python 2.4 that may affect code compatibility, including updates to integer operations, handling of large constants, and the behavior of the zip() function. Key warnings have been removed, and certain comparisons involving date and datetime have been restricted.

## Porting to Python 2.4[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.4.html#porting-to-python-2-4 "Link to this heading")
This section lists previously described changes that may require changes to your code:
  * Left shifts and hexadecimal/octal constants that are too large no longer trigger a [`FutureWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FutureWarning "FutureWarning") and return a value limited to 32 or 64 bits; instead they return a long integer.
  * Integer operations will no longer trigger an `OverflowWarning`. The `OverflowWarning` warning will disappear in Python 2.5.
  * The [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip "zip") built-in function and `itertools.izip()` now return an empty list instead of raising a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") exception if called with no arguments.
  * You can no longer compare the `date` and [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") instances provided by the [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime "datetime: Basic date and time types.") module. Two instances of different classes will now always be unequal, and relative comparisons (`<`, `>`) will raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  * `dircache.listdir()` now passes exceptions to the caller instead of returning empty lists.
  * `LexicalHandler.startDTD()` used to receive the public and system IDs in the wrong order. This has been corrected; applications relying on the wrong order need to be fixed.
  * [`fcntl.ioctl()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.ioctl "fcntl.ioctl") now warns if the _mutate_ argument is omitted and relevant.
  * The [`tarfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files.") module now generates GNU-format tar files by default.
  * Encountering a failure while importing a module no longer leaves a partially initialized module object in `sys.modules`.
  * [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") is now a constant; code that binds a new value to the name `None` is now a syntax error.
  * The `signals.signal()` function now raises a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") exception for certain illegal values; previously these errors would pass silently. For example, you can no longer set a handler on the `SIGKILL` signal.

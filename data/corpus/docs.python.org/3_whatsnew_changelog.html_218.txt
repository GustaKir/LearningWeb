### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id201 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-99086](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99086): Fix `-Wimplicit-int` compiler warning in **configure** check for `PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM`.
  * [gh-99016](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99016): Fix build with `PYTHON_FOR_REGEN=python3.8`.
  * [gh-97731](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97731): Specify the full path to the source location for `make docclean` (needed for cross-builds).
  * [gh-98949](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98949): Drop unused build dependency on `readelf`.
  * [gh-98989](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98989): Use `python3.11`, if available, for regeneration and freezing.
  * [gh-98831](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98831): Add new tooling, in `Tools/cases_generator`, to generate the interpreter switch statement from a list of opcode definitions. This only affects adding, modifying or removing instruction definitions. The instruction definitions now live in `Python/bytecodes.c`, in the form of a [custom DSL (under development)](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/blob/main/3.12/interpreter_definition.md). The tooling reads this file and writes `Python/generated_cases.c.h`, which is then included by `Python/ceval.c` to provide most of the cases of the main interpreter switch.
  * [gh-98817](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98817): Remove PCbuild/lib.pyproj: it’s not used for anything, is only a minor convenience for Visual Studio users (who probably mostly don’t even know about it), and it takes a lot of maintenance effort to keep updated.
  * [gh-98776](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98776): Fix `make regen-test-levenshtein` for out-of-tree builds.
  * [gh-98707](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98707): Don’t use vendored `libmpdec` headers if [`--with-system-libmpdec`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-system-libmpdec) is passed to **configure**. Don’t use vendored `libexpat` headers if [`--with-system-expat`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-system-expat) is passed to **configure**.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id202 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-98689](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98689): Update Windows builds to zlib v1.2.13. v1.2.12 has [**CVE 2022-37434**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-37434), but the vulnerable `inflateGetHeader` API is not used by Python.
  * [gh-98790](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98790): Assumes that a missing `DLLs` directory means that standard extension modules are in the executable’s directory.
  * [gh-98745](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98745): Update `py.exe` launcher to install 3.11 by default and 3.12 on request.
  * [gh-98692](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98692): Fix the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) ignoring unrecognized shebang lines instead of treating them as local paths
  * [gh-94328](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94328): Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.39.4.


### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id203 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-94328](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94328): Update macOS installer to SQLite 3.39.4.

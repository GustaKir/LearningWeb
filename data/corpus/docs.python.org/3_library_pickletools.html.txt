# `pickletools` — Tools for pickle developers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickletools.html#module-pickletools "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/pickletools.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/pickletools.py)
This module contains various constants relating to the intimate details of the [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") module, some lengthy comments about the implementation, and a few useful functions for analyzing pickled data. The contents of this module are useful for Python core developers who are working on the [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."); ordinary users of the [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") module probably won’t find the [`pickletools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickletools.html#module-pickletools "pickletools: Contains extensive comments about the pickle protocols and pickle-machine opcodes, as well as some useful functions.") module relevant.
## Command line usage[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickletools.html#command-line-usage "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.2.
When invoked from the command line, `python -m pickletools` will disassemble the contents of one or more pickle files. Note that if you want to see the Python object stored in the pickle rather than the details of pickle format, you may want to use `-m pickle` instead. However, when the pickle file that you want to examine comes from an untrusted source, `-m pickletools` is a safer option because it does not execute pickle bytecode.
For example, with a tuple `(1, 2)` pickled in file `x.pickle`:
```
$ python-mpicklex.pickle
(1, 2)
$ python-mpickletoolsx.pickle
  0: \x80 PROTO   3
  2: K  BININT1  1
  4: K  BININT1  2
  6: \x86 TUPLE2
  7: q  BINPUT   0
  9: .  STOP
highest protocol among opcodes = 2

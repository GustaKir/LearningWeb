Title: Introduction to Ttk in Tkinter
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
Summary: Ttk (Themed Tk) is an enhanced set of Tk widgets that offers improved aesthetics across different platforms compared to classic Tk widgets. It is included with Tk version 8.5 and is accessible via the `tkinter.ttk` module. Ttk leverages the underlying OS facilities for rendering, ensuring a consistent look and feel for applications built with Tkinter.

Ttk
    
Themed Tk (Ttk) is a newer family of Tk widgets that provide a much better appearance on different platforms than many of the classic Tk widgets. Ttk is distributed as part of Tk, starting with Tk version 8.5. Python bindings are provided in a separate module, [`tkinter.ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set").
Internally, Tk and Ttk use facilities of the underlying operating system, i.e., Xlib on Unix/X11, Cocoa on macOS, GDI on Windows.
When your Python application uses a class in Tkinter, e.g., to create a widget, the [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module first assembles a Tcl/Tk command string. It passes that Tcl command string to an internal [`_tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-_tkinter "_tkinter: A binary module that contains the low-level interface to Tcl/Tk.") binary module, which then calls the Tcl interpreter to evaluate it. The Tcl interpreter will then call into the Tk and/or Ttk packages, which will in turn make calls to Xlib, Cocoa, or GDI.
## Tkinter Modules[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#tkinter-modules "Link to this heading")
Support for Tkinter is spread across several modules. Most applications will need the main [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") module, as well as the [`tkinter.ttk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set") module, which provides the modern themed widget set and API:

Title: Resource Limits in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html
Summary: This section outlines various resource limits in Python, including maximum CPU time (RLIMIT_CPU), maximum file size that can be created (RLIMIT_FSIZE), maximum heap size (RLIMIT_DATA), and maximum stack size (RLIMIT_STACK). Exceeding these limits results in specific signals being sent to the process, such as SIGXCPU for CPU time limits.
---

resource.RLIMIT_CPU[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_CPU "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum amount of processor time (in seconds) that a process can use. If this limit is exceeded, a `SIGXCPU` signal is sent to the process. (See the [`signal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#module-signal "signal: Set handlers for asynchronous events.") module documentation for information about how to catch this signal and do something useful, e.g. flush open files to disk.) 

resource.RLIMIT_FSIZE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_FSIZE "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum size of a file which the process may create. 

resource.RLIMIT_DATA[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_DATA "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum size (in bytes) of the process’s heap. 

resource.RLIMIT_STACK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_STACK "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum size (in bytes) of the call stack for the current process. This only affects the stack of the main thread in a multi-threaded process. 

resource.RLIMIT_RSS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_RSS "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum resident set size that should be made available to the process. 

resource.RLIMIT_NPROC[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_NPROC "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum number of processes the current process may create. 

resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum number of open file descriptors for the current process. 

resource.RLIMIT_OFILE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_OFILE "Link to this definition")
    
The BSD name for [`RLIMIT_NOFILE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE "resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE"). 

resource.RLIMIT_MEMLOCK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_MEMLOCK "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum address space which may be locked in memory. 

resource.RLIMIT_VMEM[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_VMEM "Link to this definition")
    
The largest area of mapped memory which the process may occupy.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): FreeBSD >= 11. 

resource.RLIMIT_AS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_AS "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum area (in bytes) of address space which may be taken by the process. 

resource.RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE "Link to this definition")
    
The number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX message queues.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.8.
Added in version 3.4. 

resource.RLIMIT_NICE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_NICE "Link to this definition")
    
The ceiling for the process’s nice level (calculated as 20 - rlim_cur).
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.12.
Added in version 3.4. 

resource.RLIMIT_RTPRIO[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_RTPRIO "Link to this definition")
    
The ceiling of the real-time priority.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.12.
Added in version 3.4. 

resource.RLIMIT_RTTIME[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_RTTIME "Link to this definition")
    
The time limit (in microseconds) on CPU time that a process can spend under real-time scheduling without making a blocking syscall.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.25.
Added in version 3.4. 

resource.RLIMIT_SIGPENDING[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_SIGPENDING "Link to this definition")
    
The number of signals which the process may queue.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Linux >= 2.6.8.
Added in version 3.4. 

resource.RLIMIT_SBSIZE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_SBSIZE "Link to this definition")
    
The maximum size (in bytes) of socket buffer usage for this user. This limits the amount of network memory, and hence the amount of mbufs, that this user may hold at any time.
[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): FreeBSD.
Added in version 3.4.

Title: Formatting Numbers with Context in Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.4.html
Summary: The `Context` instance in Python provides methods like `to_eng_string()` and `to_sci_string()` for formatting numbers. More details can be found in the `decimal` module documentation, along with a tutorial and a reference. Related resources include PEP 327 on Decimal Data Type, articles on floating-point inaccuracies, and proposed standards for decimal representation.

The `Context` instance also has various methods for formatting numbers such as `to_eng_string()` and `to_sci_string()`.
For more information, see the documentation for the [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.") module, which includes a quick-start tutorial and a reference.

A description of a decimal-based representation. This representation is being proposed as a standard, and underlies the new Python decimal type. Much of this material was written by Mike Cowlishaw, designer of the Rexx language.
## PEP 328: Multi-line Imports[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.4.html#pep-328-multi-line-imports "Link to this heading")
One language change is a small syntactic tweak aimed at making it easier to import many names from a module. In a `from module import names` statement, _names_ is a sequence of names separated by commas. If the sequence is very long, you can either write multiple imports from the same module, or you can use backslashes to escape the line endings like this:
```
fromSimpleXMLRPCServerimport SimpleXMLRPCServer,\
      SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler,\
      CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler,\
      resolve_dotted_attribute

```

The syntactic change in Python 2.4 simply allows putting the names within parentheses. Python ignores newlines within a parenthesized expression, so the backslashes are no longer needed:
```
fromSimpleXMLRPCServerimport (SimpleXMLRPCServer,
                SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler,
                CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler,
                resolve_dotted_attribute)

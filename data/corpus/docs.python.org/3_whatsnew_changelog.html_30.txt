Title: Build Improvements in Python 3
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This section details various build-related enhancements in Python 3, including fixes for redefining `EX_OK`, optimizations for functions using computed gotos with LLVM, and improvements in building the `curses` module on certain platforms. Also mentioned are adjustments in the configuration for checking SQLite library functions.

### Build[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id16 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-129539](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129539): Don’t redefine `EX_OK` when the system has the `sysexits.h` header.
  * [gh-128472](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128472): Skip BOLT optimization of functions using computed gotos, fixing errors on build with LLVM 19.
  * [gh-123925](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123925): Fix building the [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") module on platforms with libncurses but without libncursesw.
  * [gh-128321](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128321): Set `LIBS` instead of `LDFLAGS` when checking if [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") library functions are available. This fixes the ordering of linked libraries during checks, which was incorrect when using a statically linked `libsqlite3`.
  * [gh-127865](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127865): Fix build failure on systems without thread-locals support.


## Python 3.13.1 final[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-1-final "Link to this heading")
_Release date: 2024-12-03_
### macOS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id17 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-124448](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124448): Update bundled Tcl/Tk in macOS installer to 8.6.15.


### Windows[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id18 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-126911](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126911): Update credits command output.
  * [gh-118973](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118973): Ensures the experimental free-threaded install includes the `_tkinter` module. The optional Tcl/Tk component must also be installed in order for the module to work.
  * [gh-126497](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126497): Fixes venv failure due to missing redirector executables in experimental free-threaded installs.
  * [gh-126074](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126074): Removed unnecessary DLLs from Windows embeddable package
  * [gh-125315](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125315): Avoid crashing in [`platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#module-platform "platform: Retrieves as much platform identifying data as possible.") due to slow WMI calls on some Windows machines.
  * [gh-126084](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126084): Fix venvwlauncher to launch pythonw instead of python so no extra console window is created.
  * [gh-125842](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125842): Fix a [`SystemError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemError "SystemError") when [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit") is called with `0xffffffff` on Windows.
  * [gh-125550](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125550): Enable the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) to detect Python 3.14 installs from the Windows Store.
  * [gh-124448](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124448): Updated bundled Tcl/Tk to 8.6.15.


### Tools/Demos[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id19 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-126807](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126807): Fix extraction warnings in **pygettext.py** caused by mistaking function definitions for function calls.
  * [gh-126167](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126167): The iOS testbed was modified so that it can be used by third-party projects for testing purposes.


### Tests[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id20 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-126909](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126909): Fix test_os extended attribute tests to work on filesystems with 1 KiB xattr size limit.
  * [gh-125041](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125041): Re-enable skipped tests for [`zlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") on the s390x architecture: only skip checks of the compressed bytes, which can be different between zlib’s software implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.
  * [gh-124295](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124295): Add translation tests to the [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library.") module.

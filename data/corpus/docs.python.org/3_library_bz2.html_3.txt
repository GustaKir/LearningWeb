Title: bz2.BZ2Decompressor Class
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html
Summary: The bz2.BZ2Decompressor class is used to create a new decompressor object for incremental data decompression. Unlike the decompress() function, it does not handle multiple compressed streams transparently; a new decompressor is required for each stream.
---

_class_ bz2.BZ2Decompressor[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor "Link to this definition")
    
Create a new decompressor object. This object may be used to decompress data incrementally. For one-shot compression, use the [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.decompress "bz2.decompress") function instead.
Note
This class does not transparently handle inputs containing multiple compressed streams, unlike [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.decompress "bz2.decompress") and [`BZ2File`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2File "bz2.BZ2File"). If you need to decompress a multi-stream input with [`BZ2Decompressor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor "bz2.BZ2Decompressor"), you must use a new decompressor for each stream. 

decompress(_data_ , _max_length =-1_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.decompress "Link to this definition")
    
Decompress _data_ (a [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object)), returning uncompressed data as bytes. Some of _data_ may be buffered internally, for use in later calls to [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.decompress "bz2.decompress"). The returned data should be concatenated with the output of any previous calls to [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.decompress "bz2.decompress").
If _max_length_ is nonnegative, returns at most _max_length_ bytes of decompressed data. If this limit is reached and further output can be produced, the [`needs_input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.needs_input "bz2.BZ2Decompressor.needs_input") attribute will be set to `False`. In this case, the next call to [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.decompress "bz2.BZ2Decompressor.decompress") may provide _data_ as `b''` to obtain more of the output.
If all of the input data was decompressed and returned (either because this was less than _max_length_ bytes, or because _max_length_ was negative), the [`needs_input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.needs_input "bz2.BZ2Decompressor.needs_input") attribute will be set to `True`.
Attempting to decompress data after the end of stream is reached raises an [`EOFError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError "EOFError"). Any data found after the end of the stream is ignored and saved in the [`unused_data`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.unused_data "bz2.BZ2Decompressor.unused_data") attribute.
Changed in version 3.5: Added the _max_length_ parameter. 

eof[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.eof "Link to this definition")
    
`True` if the end-of-stream marker has been reached.
Added in version 3.3. 

unused_data[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.unused_data "Link to this definition")
    
Data found after the end of the compressed stream.
If this attribute is accessed before the end of the stream has been reached, its value will be `b''`. 

needs_input[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.needs_input "Link to this definition")
    
`False` if the [`decompress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Decompressor.decompress "bz2.BZ2Decompressor.decompress") method can provide more decompressed data before requiring new uncompressed input.
Added in version 3.5.
## One-shot (de)compression[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#one-shot-de-compression "Link to this heading") 

bz2.compress(_data_ , _compresslevel =9_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.compress "Link to this definition")
    
Compress _data_ , a [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).
_compresslevel_ , if given, must be an integer between `1` and `9`. The default is `9`.
For incremental compression, use a [`BZ2Compressor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.BZ2Compressor "bz2.BZ2Compressor") instead.

### Windows[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#id211 "Link to this heading")
  * [gh-98360](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98360): Fixes [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") spawning child processes on Windows from a virtual environment to ensure that child processes that also use [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") to spawn more children will recognize that they are in a virtual environment.
  * [gh-98414](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98414): Fix `py.exe` launcher handling of `-V:_<company>_/`option when default preferences have been set in environment variables or configuration files.
  * [gh-97728](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97728): Fix possible crashes caused by the use of uninitialized variables when pass invalid arguments in [`os.system()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system "os.system") on Windows and in Windows-specific modules (like `winreg`).
  * [gh-90989](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90989): Made [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) install per-user by default (unless an all users install already exists), and clarify some text in the installer.
  * [gh-97649](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97649): The `Tools` directory is no longer installed on Windows
  * [gh-96965](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96965): Update libffi to 3.4.3
  * [gh-96577](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96577): Fixes a potential buffer overrun in `msilib`.
  * [gh-96559](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96559): Fixes the Windows launcher not using the compatible interpretation of default tags found in configuration files when no tag was passed to the command.
  * [gh-94781](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94781): Fix `pcbuild.proj` to clean previous instances of output files in `Python\deepfreeze` and `Python\frozen_modules` directories on Windows. Patch by Charlie Zhao.
  * [gh-89545](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89545): Updates [`platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#module-platform "platform: Retrieves as much platform identifying data as possible.") code getting the Windows version to use native Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries to determine OS version, type, and architecture.
  * [gh-95733](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95733): Make certain requirements of the Windows Store package optional to allow installing on earlier updates of Windows.
  * [gh-95656](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95656): Enable the [`enable_load_extension()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension "sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension") [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") API.
  * [gh-95587](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95587): Fixes some issues where the Windows installer would incorrectly detect certain features of an existing install when upgrading.
  * [gh-94399](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94399): Restores the behaviour of [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) for `/usr/bin/env` shebang lines, which will now search `PATH` for an executable matching the given command. If none is found, the usual search process is used.
  * [gh-95445](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95445): Fixes the unsuccessful removal of the HTML document directory when uninstalling with Windows msi.
  * [gh-95359](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95359): Fix [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) handling of `py.ini` commands (it was incorrectly expecting a `py_` prefix on keys) and crashes when reading per-user configuration file.
  * [gh-95285](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95285): Fix [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) handling of command lines where it is only passed a short executable name.
  * [gh-90844](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90844): Allow virtual environments to correctly launch when they have spaces in the path.
  * [gh-94772](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94772): Fix incorrect handling of shebang lines in py.exe launcher
  * [gh-94018](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94018): [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.") will now remove trailing spaces from path components when extracting files on Windows.
  * [gh-93824](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93824): Drag and drop of files onto Python files in Windows Explorer has been enabled for Wind

Title: Python Installation Options on Windows
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
Summary: This section details various installation options for Python on Windows, including command-line flags for silent installations and customization options for users. Examples are provided for installing Python system-wide and creating shortcuts for personal installations without the test suite.
---

db`) | 0  
Include_tcltk | Install Tcl/Tk support and IDLE | 1  
Include_test | Install standard library test suite | 1  
Include_tools | Install utility scripts | 1  
LauncherOnly | Only installs the launcher. This will override most other options. | 0  
SimpleInstall | Disable most install UI | 0  
SimpleInstallDescription | A custom message to display when the simplified install UI is used. | (empty)  
For example, to silently install a default, system-wide Python installation, you could use the following command (from an elevated command prompt):
```
python-3.9.0.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Include_test=0

```

To allow users to easily install a personal copy of Python without the test suite, you could provide a shortcut with the following command. This will display a simplified initial page and disallow customization:
```
python-3.9.0.exe InstallAllUsers=0 Include_launcher=0 Include_test=0
  SimpleInstall=1 SimpleInstallDescription="Just for me, no test suite."

```

(Note that omitting the launcher also omits file associations, and is only recommended for per-user installs when there is also a system-wide installation that included the launcher.)
The options listed above can also be provided in a file named `unattend.xml` alongside the executable. This file specifies a list of options and values. When a value is provided as an attribute, it will be converted to a number if possible. Values provided as element text are always left as strings. This example file sets the same options as the previous example:
```
<Options>
<OptionName="InstallAllUsers"Value="no"/>
<OptionName="Include_launcher"Value="0"/>
<OptionName="Include_test"Value="no"/>
<OptionName="SimpleInstall"Value="yes"/>
<OptionName="SimpleInstallDescription">Justforme,notestsuite</Option>
</Options>

```

### 4.1.4. Installing Without Downloading[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-without-downloading "Link to this heading")
As some features of Python are not included in the initial installer download, selecting those features may require an internet connection. To avoid this need, all possible components may be downloaded on-demand to create a complete _layout_ that will no longer require an internet connection regardless of the selected features. Note that this download may be bigger than required, but where a large number of installations are going to be performed it is very useful to have a locally cached copy.
Execute the following command from Command Prompt to download all possible required files. Remember to substitute `python-3.9.0.exe` for the actual name of your installer, and to create layouts in their own directories to avoid collisions between files with the same name.
```
python-3.9.0.exe /layout [optional target directory]

Title: Python 3.10 Updates on OpenSSL and Gzip Module Changes
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: Python 3.10 and newer requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 for improved performance of `pbkdf2_hmac()`. The `filename` attribute of `gzip.GzipFile` has been removed, favoring the `name` attribute instead, following deprecation since Python 2.6. Changes were patched by Victor Stinner.
---

Python 3.10 and newer requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 ([**PEP 644**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0644/)): this OpenSSL version provides a C implementation of [`pbkdf2_hmac()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac "hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac") which is faster. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-94196](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94196): [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects."): Remove the `filename` attribute of [`gzip.GzipFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile"), deprecated since Python 2.6, use the [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#gzip.GzipFile.name "gzip.GzipFile.name") attribute instead. In write mode, the `filename` attribute added `'.gz'` file extension if it was not present. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-94182](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94182): run the [`asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher "asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher") on the running loop, this allows event loops to run subprocesses when there is no default event loop running on the main thread
  * [gh-94169](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94169): Remove `io.OpenWrapper` and `_pyio.OpenWrapper`, deprecated in Python 3.10: just use [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") instead. The [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") ([`io.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.open "io.open")) function is a built-in function. Since Python 3.10, `_pyio.open()` is also a static method. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  * [gh-91742](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91742): Fix [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") crash after jump caused by a null pointer dereference. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  * [gh-94101](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94101): Manual instantiation of [`ssl.SSLSession`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLSession "ssl.SSLSession") objects is no longer allowed as it lead to misconfigured instances that crashed the interpreter when attributes where accessed on them.
  * [gh-84753](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84753): [`inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.iscoroutinefunction "inspect.iscoroutinefunction"), [`inspect.isgeneratorfunction()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.isgeneratorfunction "inspect.isgeneratorfunction"), and [`inspect.isasyncgenfunction()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.isasyncgenfunction "inspect.isasyncgenfunction") now properly return `True` for duck-typed function-like objects like instances of [`unittest.mock.AsyncMock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.AsyncMock "unittest.mock.AsyncMock").
This makes [`inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.iscoroutinefunction "inspect.iscoroutinefunction") consistent with the behavior of `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()`. Patch by Mehdi ABAAKOUK.
  * [gh-94028](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/94028): Fix a regression in the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") where statement objects were not properly cleared and reset after use in cursor iters. The regression was introduced by PR 27884 in Python 3.11a1. Patch by Erlend E.

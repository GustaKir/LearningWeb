# 13. What Now?[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/whatnow.html#what-now "Link to this heading")
Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?
This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:
  * [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index):
You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a _lot_ of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.
  * [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index) explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.
  * [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index): A detailed explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.

  * <https://www.python.org>: The major Python web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the web.
  * <https://docs.python.org>: Fast access to Python’s documentation.
  * <https://pypi.org>: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/whatnow.html#id2), is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.
  * <https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/>: The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules, and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)
  * <https://pyvideo.org> collects links to Python-related videos from conferences and user-group meetings.
  * <https://scipy.org>: The Scientific Python project includes modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers, random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.

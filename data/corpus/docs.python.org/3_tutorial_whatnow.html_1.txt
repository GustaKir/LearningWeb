Title: Community Support and Resources for Python
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/whatnow.html
Summary: For Python-related inquiries, users can engage with the community through the newsgroup _comp.lang.python_ or the mailing list at python-list@python.org, where discussions on questions, feature suggestions, and new module announcements occur. Users are advised to consult the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) prior to posting to find potential solutions.
---

For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the newsgroup _comp.lang.python_ , or send them to the mailing list at python-list@python.org. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be forwarded to the other. There are hundreds of postings a day, asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules. Mailing list archives are available at <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/>.
Before posting, be sure to check the list of [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/index.html#faq-index) (also called the FAQ). The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.

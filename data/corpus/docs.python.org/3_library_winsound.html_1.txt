Title: Using Sound Aliases in winsound
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html
Summary: The `SND_ALIAS` parameter in the winsound module allows the playback of system sounds associated with names in the registry. If the specified name is not found, the system default sound is played unless `SND_NODEFAULT` is used, in which case an error is raised if no default sound is available. The section includes common sound names supported by Win32 systems.

winsound.SND_ALIAS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_ALIAS "Link to this definition")
    
The _sound_ parameter is a sound association name from the registry. If the registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless [`SND_NODEFAULT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_NODEFAULT "winsound.SND_NODEFAULT") is also specified. If no default sound is registered, raise [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). Do not use with [`SND_FILENAME`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_FILENAME "winsound.SND_FILENAME").
All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many more:
[`PlaySound()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.PlaySound "winsound.PlaySound") _name_ | Corresponding Control Panel Sound name  
---|---  
`'SystemAsterisk'` | Asterisk  
`'SystemExclamation'` | Exclamation  
`'SystemExit'` | Exit Windows  
`'SystemHand'` | Critical Stop  
`'SystemQuestion'` | Question  
For example:
```
importwinsound
# Play Windows exit sound.
winsound.PlaySound("SystemExit", winsound.SND_ALIAS)
# Probably play Windows default sound, if any is registered (because
# "*" probably isn't the registered name of any sound).
winsound.PlaySound("*", winsound.SND_ALIAS)

```


winsound.SND_LOOP[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_LOOP "Link to this definition")
    
Play the sound repeatedly. The [`SND_ASYNC`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_ASYNC "winsound.SND_ASYNC") flag must also be used to avoid blocking. Cannot be used with [`SND_MEMORY`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_MEMORY "winsound.SND_MEMORY"). 

winsound.SND_MEMORY[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_MEMORY "Link to this definition")
    
The _sound_ parameter to [`PlaySound()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.PlaySound "winsound.PlaySound") is a memory image of a WAV file, as a [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).
Note
This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a combination of this flag and [`SND_ASYNC`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_ASYNC "winsound.SND_ASYNC") will raise [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). 

winsound.SND_PURGE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_PURGE "Link to this definition")
    
Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.
Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms. 

winsound.SND_ASYNC[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_ASYNC "Link to this definition")
    
Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously. 

winsound.SND_NODEFAULT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_NODEFAULT "Link to this definition")
    
If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound. 

winsound.SND_NOSTOP[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_NOSTOP "Link to this definition")
    
Do not interrupt sounds currently playing. 

winsound.SND_NOWAIT[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_NOWAIT "Link to this definition")
    
Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.
Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms. 

winsound.SND_APPLICATION[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_APPLICATION "Link to this definition")
    
The _sound_ parameter is an application-specific alias in the registry. This flag can be combined with the [`SND_ALIAS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.SND_ALIAS "winsound.SND_ALIAS") flag to specify an application-defined sound alias. 

winsound.MB_ICONASTERISK[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.MB_ICONASTERISK "Link to this definition")
    
Play the `SystemDefault` sound. 

winsound.MB_ICONEXCLAMATION[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "Link to this definition")
    
Play the `SystemExclamation` sound. 

winsound.MB_ICONHAND[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.MB_ICONHAND "Link to this definition")
    
Play the `SystemHand` sound. 

winsound.MB_ICONQUESTION[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html#winsound.MB_ICONQUESTION "Link to this definition")
    
Play the `SystemQuestion` sound.

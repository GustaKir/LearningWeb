Title: Python Statistics and Object Copying Enhancements
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
Summary: This document highlights performance improvements in the statistics module, specifically for mean and variance calculations. It also details several bug fixes, including enhancements to object copying with boolean values, deep copying of minidom documents, and improvements to the dir() function for ElementTree.Element.
---

As a side effect, statistics.mean and statistics.variance should be significantly faster.
  * [bpo-25718](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25718): Fixed copying object with state with boolean value is false.
  * [bpo-10131](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10131): Fixed deep copying of minidom documents. Based on patch by Marian Ganisin.
  * [bpo-7990](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=7990): dir() on ElementTree.Element now lists properties: “tag”, “text”, “tail” and “attrib”. Original patch by Santoso Wijaya.
  * [bpo-25725](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25725): Fixed a reference leak in pickle.loads() when unpickling invalid data including tuple instructions.
  * [bpo-25663](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25663): In the Readline completer, avoid listing duplicate global names, and search the global namespace before searching builtins.
  * [bpo-25688](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25688): Fixed file leak in ElementTree.iterparse() raising an error.
  * [bpo-23914](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23914): Fixed SystemError raised by unpickler on broken pickle data.
  * [bpo-25691](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25691): Fixed crash on deleting ElementTree.Element attributes.
  * [bpo-25624](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25624): ZipFile now always writes a ZIP_STORED header for directory entries. Patch by Dingyuan Wang.
  * [bpo-25626](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25626): Change three zlib functions to accept sizes that fit in Py_ssize_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT_MAX. This resolves a regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than 2 or 4 GiB. The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress() max_length parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.
  * [bpo-25583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25583): Avoid incorrect errors raised by os.makedirs(exist_ok=True) when the OS gives priority to errors such as EACCES over EEXIST.
  * [bpo-25593](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25593): Change semantics of EventLoop.stop() in asyncio.
  * [bpo-6973](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=6973): When we know a subprocess.Popen process has died, do not allow the send_signal(), terminate(), or kill() methods to do anything as they could potentially signal a different process.
  * [bpo-23883](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23883): Added missing APIs to __all__ to match the documented APIs for the following modules: calendar, csv, enum, fileinput, ftplib, logging, optparse, tarfile, threading and wave. Also added a test.support.check__all__() helper. Patches by Jacek Kołodziej, Mauro S. M. Rodrigues and Joel Taddei.
  * [bpo-25590](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25590): In the Readline completer, only call getattr() once per attribute. Also complete names of attributes such as properties and slots which are listed by dir() but not yet created on an instance.
  * [bpo-25498](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25498): Fix a crash when garbage-collecting ctypes objects created by wrapping a memoryview. This was a regression made in 3.5a1. Based on patch by Eryksun.
  * [bpo-25584](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25584): Added “escape” to the __all__ list in the glob module.
  * [bpo-25584](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25584): Fixed recursive glob() with patterns starting with `**`.
  * [bpo-25446](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25446): Fix regression in smtplib’s AUTH LOGIN support.
  * [bpo-18010](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18010): Fix the pydoc web server’s module search function to handle exceptions from importing packages.
  * [bpo-25554](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25554): Got rid of circular references in regular expression parsing.
  * [bpo-18973](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18973): Command-line interface of the calendar module now uses argparse instead of optparse.
  * [bpo-25510](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25510): fileinput.FileInput.readline() now returns b’’ instead of ‘’ at the end if the FileInput was opened with binary mode. Patch by Ryosuke Ito.
  * [bpo-25503](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25503): Fixed inspect.getdoc() for inherited docstrings of properties. Original patch by John Mark Vandenberg.
  * [bpo-25515](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25515): Always use os.urandom as a source of randomness in uuid.uuid4.
  * [bpo-21827](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21827): Fixed textwrap.dedent() for the case when largest common whitespace is a substring of smallest leading whitespace.

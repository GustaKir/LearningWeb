Title: Installing Binary Extensions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html
Summary: This section discusses the transition from source-based distribution of Python extensions to the use of binary wheels, improving the installation process for users. It highlights the expectation that users will be able to install pre-built extensions more readily, particularly for Windows and macOS, thus reducing the need to compile from source.

### Installing binary extensions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-binary-extensions "Link to this heading")
Python has typically relied heavily on source based distribution, with end users being expected to compile extension modules from source as part of the installation process.
With the introduction of support for the binary `wheel` format, and the ability to publish wheels for at least Windows and macOS through the Python Package Index, this problem is expected to diminish over time, as users are more regularly able to install pre-built extensions rather than needing to build them themselves.
Some of the solutions for installing [scientific software](https://packaging.python.org/science/) that are not yet available as pre-built `wheel` files may also help with obtaining other binary extensions without needing to build them locally.

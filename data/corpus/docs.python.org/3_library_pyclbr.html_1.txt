Title: Function Class in pyclbr Module
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html
Summary: The `Function` class in the `pyclbr` module represents functions defined by 'def' statements. It includes attributes such as 'file' (the file name), 'module' (the defining module's name), 'name' (the function's name), 'lineno' (the starting line number of the definition), and 'parent' (parent context for top-level functions).

_class_ pyclbr.Function[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function "Link to this definition")
    
Class `Function` instances describe functions defined by def statements. They have the following attributes: 

file[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.file "Link to this definition")
    
Name of the file in which the function is defined. 

module[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.module "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the module defining the function described. 

name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.name "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the function. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number in the file where the definition starts. 

parent[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.parent "Link to this definition")
    
For top-level functions, `None`. For nested functions, the parent.
Added in version 3.7. 

children[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.children "Link to this definition")
    
A [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and classes.
Added in version 3.7. 

is_async[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function.is_async "Link to this definition")
    
`True` for functions that are defined with the [`async`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) prefix, `False` otherwise.
Added in version 3.10.
## Class Objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#class-objects "Link to this heading") 

_class_ pyclbr.Class[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class "Link to this definition")
    
Class `Class` instances describe classes defined by class statements. They have the same attributes as [`Functions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Function "pyclbr.Function") and two more. 

file[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.file "Link to this definition")
    
Name of the file in which the class is defined. 

module[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.module "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the module defining the class described. 

name[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.name "Link to this definition")
    
The name of the class. 

lineno[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.lineno "Link to this definition")
    
The line number in the file where the definition starts. 

parent[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.parent "Link to this definition")
    
For top-level classes, `None`. For nested classes, the parent.
Added in version 3.7. 

children[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.children "Link to this definition")
    
A dictionary mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and classes.
Added in version 3.7. 

super[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.super "Link to this definition")
    
A list of `Class` objects which describe the immediate base classes of the class being described. Classes which are named as superclasses but which are not discoverable by [`readmodule_ex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.readmodule_ex "pyclbr.readmodule_ex") are listed as a string with the class name instead of as `Class` objects. 

methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.methods "Link to this definition")
    
A [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") mapping method names to line numbers. This can be derived from the newer [`children`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pyclbr.html#pyclbr.Class.children "pyclbr.Class.children") dictionary, but remains for back-compatibility.

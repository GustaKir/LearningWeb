# [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle "turtle: An educational framework for simple graphics applications") — Turtle graphics[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/turtle.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/turtle.py)
## Introduction[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#introduction "Link to this heading")
Turtle graphics is an implementation of [the popular geometric drawing tools introduced in Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_\(robot\)), developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.
## Get started[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#get-started "Link to this heading")
Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an `import turtle`, give it the command `turtle.forward(15)`, and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command `turtle.right(25)`, and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.

Turtle can draw intricate shapes using programs that repeat simple moves.

In Python, turtle graphics provides a representation of a physical “turtle” (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor.
It’s an effective and well-proven way for learners to encounter programming concepts and interaction with software, as it provides instant, visible feedback. It also provides convenient access to graphical output in general.
Turtle drawing was originally created as an educational tool, to be used by teachers in the classroom. For the programmer who needs to produce some graphical output it can be a way to do that without the overhead of introducing more complex or external libraries into their work.
## Tutorial[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#tutorial "Link to this heading")
New users should start here. In this tutorial we’ll explore some of the basics of turtle drawing.
### Starting a turtle environment[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#starting-a-turtle-environment "Link to this heading")
In a Python shell, import all the objects of the `turtle` module:
```
fromturtleimport *

```

If you run into a `No module named '_tkinter'` error, you’ll have to install the [`Tk interface package`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter "tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces") on your system.
### Basic drawing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#basic-drawing "Link to this heading")
Send the turtle forward 100 steps:
```
forward(100)

```

You should see (most likely, in a new window on your display) a line drawn by the turtle, heading East. Change the direction of the turtle, so that it turns 120 degrees left (anti-clockwise):
```
left(120)

```

Let’s continue by drawing a triangle:
```
forward(100)
left(120)
forward(100)

Title: Python Test Support Constants
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html
Summary: This section describes various constants in the `test.support` module, including `PGO` for controlling test execution, `PIPE_MAX_SIZE` for managing pipe operations, `Py_DEBUG` indicating if Python is built in debug mode, and `SOCK_MAX_SIZE` related to socket buffer sizes.
---

test.support.PGO[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.PGO "Link to this definition")
    
Set when tests can be skipped when they are not useful for PGO. 

test.support.PIPE_MAX_SIZE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.PIPE_MAX_SIZE "Link to this definition")
    
A constant that is likely larger than the underlying OS pipe buffer size, to make writes blocking. 

test.support.Py_DEBUG[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.Py_DEBUG "Link to this definition")
    
`True` if Python was built with the [`Py_DEBUG`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#c.Py_DEBUG "Py_DEBUG") macro defined, that is, if Python was [built in debug mode](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#debug-build).
Added in version 3.12. 

test.support.SOCK_MAX_SIZE[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.SOCK_MAX_SIZE "Link to this definition")
    
A constant that is likely larger than the underlying OS socket buffer size, to make writes blocking. 

test.support.TEST_SUPPORT_DIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.TEST_SUPPORT_DIR "Link to this definition")
    
Set to the top level directory that contains [`test.support`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#module-test.support "test.support: Support for Python's regression test suite."). 

test.support.TEST_HOME_DIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.TEST_HOME_DIR "Link to this definition")
    
Set to the top level directory for the test package. 

test.support.TEST_DATA_DIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.TEST_DATA_DIR "Link to this definition")
    
Set to the `data` directory within the test package. 

test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t "Link to this definition")
    
Set to [`sys.maxsize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize "sys.maxsize") for big memory tests. 

test.support.max_memuse[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.max_memuse "Link to this definition")
    
Set by [`set_memlimit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.set_memlimit "test.support.set_memlimit") as the memory limit for big memory tests. Limited by [`MAX_Py_ssize_t`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t "test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t"). 

test.support.real_max_memuse[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.real_max_memuse "Link to this definition")
    
Set by [`set_memlimit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.set_memlimit "test.support.set_memlimit") as the memory limit for big memory tests. Not limited by [`MAX_Py_ssize_t`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t "test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t"). 

test.support.MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS "Link to this definition")
    
Set to `True` if Python is built without docstrings (the `WITH_DOC_STRINGS` macro is not defined). See the [`configure --without-doc-strings`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-doc-strings) option.
See also the [`HAVE_DOCSTRINGS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.HAVE_DOCSTRINGS "test.support.HAVE_DOCSTRINGS") variable. 

test.support.HAVE_DOCSTRINGS[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.HAVE_DOCSTRINGS "Link to this definition")
    
Set to `True` if function docstrings are available. See the [`python -OO`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O) option, which strips docstrings of functions implemented in Python.
See also the [`MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS "test.support.MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS") variable. 

test.support.TEST_HTTP_URL[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.TEST_HTTP_URL "Link to this definition")
    
Define the URL of a dedicated HTTP server for the network tests. 

test.support.ALWAYS_EQ[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.ALWAYS_EQ "Link to this definition")
    
Object that is equal to anything. Used to test mixed type comparison. 

test.support.NEVER_EQ[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.NEVER_EQ "Link to this definition")
    
Object that is not equal to anything (even to [`ALWAYS_EQ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.ALWAYS_EQ "test.support.ALWAYS_EQ")). Used to test mixed type comparison. 

test.support.LARGEST[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html#test.support.LARGEST "Link to this definition")
    
Object that is greater than anything (except itself). Used to test mixed type comparison.

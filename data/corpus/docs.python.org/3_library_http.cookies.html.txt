# `http.cookies` — HTTP state management[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#module-http.cookies "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/http/cookies.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/http/cookies.py)
The [`http.cookies`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#module-http.cookies "http.cookies: Support for HTTP state management \(cookies\).") module defines classes for abstracting the concept of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable data-type as cookie value.
The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the [**RFC 2109**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109.html) and [**RFC 2068**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068.html) specifications. It has since been discovered that MSIE 3.0x didn’t follow the character rules outlined in those specs; many current-day browsers and servers have also relaxed parsing rules when it comes to cookie handling. As a result, this module now uses parsing rules that are a bit less strict than they once were.
The character set, [`string.ascii_letters`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_letters "string.ascii_letters"), [`string.digits`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.digits "string.digits") and `!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:` denote the set of valid characters allowed by this module in a cookie name (as [`key`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel.key "http.cookies.Morsel.key")).
Changed in version 3.3: Allowed ‘:’ as a valid cookie name character.
Note
On encountering an invalid cookie, [`CookieError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.CookieError "http.cookies.CookieError") is raised, so if your cookie data comes from a browser you should always prepare for invalid data and catch [`CookieError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.CookieError "http.cookies.CookieError") on parsing. 

_exception_ http.cookies.CookieError[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.CookieError "Link to this definition")
    
Exception failing because of [**RFC 2109**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109.html) invalidity: incorrect attributes, incorrect _Set-Cookie_ header, etc.

URL: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html
Summary: Python 2.0 introduced numerous improvements and bug fixes across its standard library, impacting modules such as readline, ConfigParser, cgi, calendar, posix, and others.

## Module changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html#module-changes "Link to this heading")
Lots of improvements and bugfixes were made to Python’s extensive standard library; some of the affected modules include [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)"), [`ConfigParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#module-configparser "configparser: Configuration file parser."), `cgi`, [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program."), [`posix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/posix.html#module-posix "posix: The most common POSIX system calls \(normally used via module os\). \(Unix\)"), [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)"), `xmllib`, `aifc`, `chunk`, [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."), [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random "random: Generate pseudo-random numbers with various common distributions."), [`shelve`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html#module-shelve "shelve: Python object persistence."), and `nntplib`. Consult the CVS logs for the exact patch-by-patch details.
Brian Gallew contributed OpenSSL support for the [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") module. OpenSSL is an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer, which encrypts the data being sent over a socket. When compiling Python, you can edit `Modules/Setup` to include SSL support, which adds an additional function to the [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") module: `socket.ssl(socket, keyfile, certfile)`, which takes a socket object and returns an SSL socket. The [`httplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#module-http "http: HTTP status codes and messages") and [`urllib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html#module-urllib "urllib") modules were also changed to support `https://` URLs, though no one has implemented FTP or SMTP over SSL.
The [`httplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#module-http "http: HTTP status codes and messages") module has been rewritten by Greg Stein to support HTTP/1.1.
Backward compatibility with the 1.5 version of `httplib` is provided, though using HTTP/1.1 features such as pipelining will require rewriting code to use a different set of interfaces.
The `Tkinter` module now supports Tcl/Tk version 8.1, 8.2, or 8.3, and support for the older 7.x versions has been dropped. The Tkinter module now supports displaying Unicode strings in Tk widgets. Also, Fredrik Lundh contributed an optimization which makes operations like `create_line` and `create_polygon` much faster, especially when using lots of coordinates.
The [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") module has been greatly extended, starting from Oliver Andrich’s enhanced version, to provide many additional functions from ncurses and SYSV curses, such as colour, alternative character set support, pads, and mouse support. This means the module is no longer compatible with operating systems that only have BSD curses, but there don’t seem to be any currently maintained OSes that fall into this category.
As mentioned in the earlier discussion of 2.0’s Unicode support, the underlying implementation of the regular expressions provided by the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") module has been changed. SRE, a new regular expression engine written by Fredrik Lundh and partially funded by Hewlett Packard, supports matching against both 8-bit strings and Unicode strings.
## New modules[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.0.html#new-modules "Link to this heading")
A number of new modules were added. We’ll simply list them with brief descriptions; consult the 2.0 documentation for the details of a particular module.
  * [`atexit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions."): For registering functions to be called before the Python interpreter exits. Code that currently sets `sys.exitfunc` directly should be changed to use the [`atexit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions.") module instead, importing [`atexit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions.") and calling [`atexit.register()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html#atexit.register "ate

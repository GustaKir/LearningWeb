Title: Changes to Turtle Module since Python 3.0
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
Summary: The Turtle module has introduced new methods such as `shearfactor()`, `shapetransform()`, and `get_shapepoly()` for linear transformations of turtle shapes, while enhancing the `tiltangle()` method for better functionality. Additionally, changes were made to the `Screen` class, including updates to the `onkeypress()` method.

## Changes since Python 3.0[Â¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#changes-since-python-3-0 "Link to this heading")
  * The [`Turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.Turtle "turtle.Turtle") methods [`shearfactor()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.shearfactor "turtle.shearfactor"), [`shapetransform()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.shapetransform "turtle.shapetransform") and [`get_shapepoly()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.get_shapepoly "turtle.get_shapepoly") have been added. Thus the full range of regular linear transforms is now available for transforming turtle shapes. [`tiltangle()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.tiltangle "turtle.tiltangle") has been enhanced in functionality: it now can be used to get or set the tilt angle.
  * The [`Screen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.Screen "turtle.Screen") method [`onkeypress()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkeypress "turtle.onkeypress") has been added as a complement to [`onkey()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkey "turtle.onkey"). As the latter binds actions to the key release event, an alias: [`onkeyrelease()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkeyrelease "turtle.onkeyrelease") was also added for it.
  * The method [`Screen.mainloop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.mainloop "turtle.mainloop") has been added, so there is no longer a need to use the standalone [`mainloop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.mainloop "turtle.mainloop") function when working with [`Screen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.Screen "turtle.Screen") and [`Turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.Turtle "turtle.Turtle") objects.
  * Two input methods have been added: [`Screen.textinput`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.textinput "turtle.textinput") and [`Screen.numinput`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.numinput "turtle.numinput"). These pop up input dialogs and return strings and numbers respectively.
  * Two example scripts `tdemo_nim.py` and `tdemo_round_dance.py` have been added to the `Lib/turtledemo` directory.

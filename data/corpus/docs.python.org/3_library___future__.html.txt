Title: __future__ — Future Statement Definitions
URL: https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html
Summary: The documentation for the `__future__` module outlines future statement definitions that enable the use of features that will not be available until future Python releases. This allows developers to write code that is compatible with future versions while maintaining backward compatibility.

# `__future__` — Future statement definitions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "Link to this heading")
**Source code:** [Lib/__future__.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/__future__.py)
Imports of the form `from __future__ import feature` are called [future statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#future). These are special-cased by the Python compiler to allow the use of new Python features in modules containing the future statement before the release in which the feature becomes standard.
While these future statements are given additional special meaning by the Python compiler, they are still executed like any other import statement and the [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions") exists and is handled by the import system the same way any other Python module would be. This design serves three purposes:
  * To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect to find the modules they’re importing.
  * To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be — or were — made mandatory. This is a form of executable documentation, and can be inspected programmatically via importing [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions") and examining its contents.
  * To ensure that [future statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#future) run under releases prior to Python 2.1 at least yield runtime exceptions (the import of [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions") will fail, because there was no module of that name prior to 2.1).

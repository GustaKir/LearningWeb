URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/deploy
Summary: This section explains the URL format for accessing a deployed Streamlit app, using an example for clarity. It also covers the option to set a custom subdomain for easier sharing of your app, with a link to further instructions on changing the app's URL.

`https://[GitHub username or organization]-[repo name]-[app path]-[branch name]-[short hash].streamlit.app `
For example, the following app is deployed from the `streamlit` organization. The repo is `demo-self-driving` and the app name is `streamlit_app.py` in the root directory. The branch name is `master` and therefore not included.
`https://streamlit-demo-self-driving-streamlit-app-8jya0g.streamlit.app `

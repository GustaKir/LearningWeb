Your Streamlit app has a few widgets in the top right to help you as you develop. These widgets also help your viewers as they use your app. We call this things “the app chrome”. The chrome includes a status area, toolbar, and app menu.
Your app menu is configurable. By default, you can access developer options from the app menu when viewing an app locally or on Streamlit Community Cloud while logged into an account with administrative access. While viewing an app, click the icon in the upper-right corner to access the menu.

The menu is split into two sections. The upper section contains options available to all viewers and the lower section contains options for developers. Read more about [customizing this menu](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#customize-the-menu) at the end of this page.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#rerun)Rerun
You can manually trigger a rerun of your app by clicking "**Rerun** " from the app menu. This rerun will not reset your session. Your widget states and values stored in [`st.session_state`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state) will be preserved. As a shortcut, without opening the app menu, you can rerun your app by pressing "**R** " on your keyboard (if you aren't currently focused on an input element).
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#settings)Settings
With the "**Settings** " option, you can control the appearance of your app while it is running. If viewing the app locally, you can set how your app responds to changes in your source code. See more about development flow in [Basic concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts#development-flow). You can also force your app to appear in wide mode, even if not set within the script using [`st.set_page_config`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config).
#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#theme-settings)Theme settings
After clicking "**Settings** " from the app menu, you can choose between "**Light** ", "**Dark** ", or "**Use system setting** " for the app's base theme. Click "**Edit active theme** " to modify the theme, color-by-color.

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#print)Print
Click "**Print** " or use keyboard shortcuts (`⌘+P` or `Ctrl+P`) to open a print dialog. This option uses your browser's built-in print-to-pdf function. To modify the appearance of your print, you can do the following:
  * Expand or collapse the sidebar before printing to respectively include or exclude it from the print.
  * Resize the sidebar in your app by clicking and dragging its right border to achieve your desired width.
  * You may need to enable "**Background graphics** " in your print dialog if you are printing in dark mode.
  * You may need to disable wide mode in [Settings](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#settings) or adjust the print scale to prevent elements from clipping off the page.


### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#record-a-screencast)Record a screencast
You can easily make screen recordings right from your app! Screen recording is supported in the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Ensure your browser is up-to-date for compatibility. Depending on your current settings, you may need to grant permission to your browser to record your screen or to use your microphone if recording a voiceover.
  1. While viewing your app, open the app menu from the upper-right corner.
  2. Click "**Record a screencast**."
  3. If you want to record audio through your microphone, check "**Also record audio**."
  4. Click "**Start recording**." (You may be prompted by your OS to permit your browser to record your screen or use your microphone.)

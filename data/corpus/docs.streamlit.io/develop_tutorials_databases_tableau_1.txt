This guide explains how to securely access data on Tableau from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the [tableauserverclient](https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/) library and Streamlit's [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/secrets-management).

#### Note
If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to [skip to the next step](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/tableau#create-personal-access-tokens).
For simplicity, we are using the cloud version of Tableau here but this guide works equally well for self-hosted deployments. First, sign up for [Tableau Online](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) or log in. Create a workbook or run one of the example workbooks under "Dashboard Starters".

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/tableau#create-personal-access-tokens)Create personal access tokens
While the Tableau API allows authentication via username and password, you should use [personal access tokens](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/security_personal_access_tokens.htm) for a production app.
Go to your [Tableau Online homepage](https://online.tableau.com/), create an access token and note down the token name and secret.

#### Note
Personal access tokens will expire if not used after 15 consecutive days.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/tableau#add-token-to-your-local-app-secrets)Add token to your local app secrets
Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add your token, the site name you created during setup, and the URL of your Tableau server like below:
`# .streamlit/secrets.toml [tableau] token_name = "xxx" token_secret = "xxx" server_url = "https://abc01.online.tableau.com/" site_id = "streamlitexample" # in your site's URL behind the server_url `

#### Important
Add this file to `.gitignore` and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/tableau#copy-your-app-secrets-to-the-cloud)Copy your app secrets to the cloud
As the `secrets.toml` file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the [app dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/) and in the app's dropdown menu, click on **Edit Secrets**. Copy the content of `secrets.toml` into the text area. More information is available at [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/tableau#add-tableauserverclient-to-your-requirements-file)Add tableauserverclient to your requirements file
Add the [tableauserverclient](https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/) package to your `requirements.txt` file, preferably pinning its version (replace `x.x.x` with the version you want installed):
`# requirements.txt tableauserverclient==x.x.x `

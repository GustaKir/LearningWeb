Play around with your new app.
  * If you want to use custom images instead of text or emojis to annotation your chart, you can replace the line containing `.mark_text()` with `.mark_image()`. For some URL string stored in a variable `IMAGE_URL`, you could do something like this:
`.mark_image(   width=12,   height=12,   url=IMAGE_URL, ) `
  * If you want to enable panning and zooming for your chart, add `.interactive()` when you define your combined chart:
`combined_chart = (data_layer + annotation_layer).interactive() `

Title: Defining Multipage Apps with st.Page and st.navigation
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/page-and-navigation
Summary: This section explains how to use `st.Page` and `st.navigation` commands to create multipage apps in Streamlit. It highlights the flexibility in organizing project files and customizing navigation menus. It also discusses the structure of the app, where the entrypoint file serves as a page router executing scripts for each page.

`st.Page` and `st.navigation` are the preferred commands for defining multipage apps. With these commands, you have flexibility to organize your project files and customize your navigation menu. Simply initialize `StreamlitPage` objects with `st.Page`, then pass those `StreamlitPage` objects to `st.navigation` in your entrypoint file (i.e. the file you pass to `streamlit run`).
This page assumes you understand the [Page terminology](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview#page-terminology) presented in the overview.

When using `st.navigation`, your entrypoint file acts like a page router. Each page is a script executed from your entrypoint file. You can define a page from a Python file or function. If you include elements or widgets in your entrypoint file, they become common elements between your pages. In this case, you can think of your entrypoint file like a picture frame around each of your pages.
You can only call `st.navigation` once per app run and you must call it from your entrypoint file. When a user selects a page in navigation (or is routed through a command like `st.switch_page`), `st.navigation` returns the selected page. You must manually execute that page with the `.run()` method. The following example is a two-page app where each page is defined by a Python file.
**Directory structure:**
`your-repository/ ├── page_1.py ├── page_2.py └── streamlit_app.py `
**`streamlit_app.py`:**
`import streamlit as st pg = st.navigation([st.Page("page_1.py"), st.Page("page_2.py")]) pg.run() `

`st.Page` lets you define a page. The first and only required argument defines your page source, which can be a Python file or function. When using Python files, your pages may be in a subdirectory (or superdirectory). The path to your page file must always be relative to the entrypoint file. Once you create your page objects, pass them to `st.navigation` to register them as pages in your app.
If you don't define your page title or URL pathname, Streamlit will infer them from the file or function name as described in the multipage apps [Overview](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview#automatic-page-labels-and-urls). However, `st.Page` lets you configure them manually. Within `st.Page`, Streamlit uses `title` to set the page label and title. Additionaly, Streamlit uses `icon` to set the page icon and favicon. If you want to have a different page title and label, or different page icon and favicon, you can use `st.set_page_config` to change the page title and/or favicon. Just call `st.set_page_config` after `st.navigation`, either in your entrypoint file or in your page source.
The following example uses `st.set_page_config` to set a page title and favicon consistently across pages. Each page will have its own label and icon in the navigation menu, but the browser tab will show a consistent title and favicon on all pages.
**Directory structure:**
`your-repository/ ├── create.py ├── delete.py └── streamlit_app.py `
**`streamlit_app.py`:**
`import streamlit as st create_page = st.Page("create.py", title="Create entry", icon=":material/add_circle:") delete_page = st.Page("delete.py", title="Delete entry", icon=":material/delete:") pg = st.navigation([create_page, delete_page]) st.set_page_config(page_title="Data manager", page_icon=":material/edit:") pg.run() `

If you want to group your pages into sections, `st.navigation` lets you insert headers within your navigation. Alternatively, you can disable the default navigation widget and build a custom navigation menu with `st.page_link`.
Additionally, you can dynamically change which pages you pass to `st.navigation`. However, only the page returned by `st.navigation` accepts the `.run()` method. If a user enters a URL with a pathname, and that pathname is not associated to a page in `st.navigation` (on first run), Streamlit will throw a "Page not found" error and redirect them to the default page.

As long as you don't want to hide a valid, accessible page in the navigation menu, the simplest way to customize your navigation menu is to organize the pages within `st.navigation`. You can sort or group pages, as well as remove any pages you don't want the user to access. This is a conveni

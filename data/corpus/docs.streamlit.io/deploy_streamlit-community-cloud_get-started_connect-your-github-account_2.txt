To deploy apps from repositories owned by a GitHub organization, Community Cloud must have permission to access the organization's repositories. If you are a member of a GitHub organization when you connect your GitHub account, your OAuth prompts will include a section labeled "Organization access."

If you have already connected your GitHub account and need to add access to an organization, follow the steps in [Manage your GitHub connection](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/manage-your-github-connection) to disconnect your GitHub account and start over. Alternatively, if you are not the owner of an organization, you can ask the owner to create a Community Cloud account for themselves and add permission directly.

For any organization you own, if authorization has not been previously granted or denied, you can click "**Grant** " before you click "**Authorize streamlit**."

For an organization you don't own, if authorization has not been previously granted or denied, you can click "**Request** " before you click "**Authorize streamlit**."

If someone has already started the process of authorizing Streamlit for your organization, the OAuth prompt will show the current status.
#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#approved-access)Approved access
If an organization has already granted Streamlit access, the OAuth prompt shows a green check (_check_).

#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#pending-access)Pending access
If a request has been previously sent but not yet approved, the OAuth prompt show "Access request pending." Follow up with the organization's owner to accept the request in GitHub.

#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#denied-access)Denied access
If a request has been previously sent and denied, the OAuth prompt shows a red X (_close_). In this case, the organization owner will need to authorize Streamlit from GitHub. See GitHub's documentation on [OAuth apps and organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#oauth-apps-and-organizations).

Title: Managing App Dependencies in Streamlit Community Cloud
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/app-dependencies
Summary: To deploy your app on Streamlit Community Cloud, include a `packages.txt` file in your repository's root directory to automatically install necessary packages. Add one apt-get dependency per line, such as `mysqlclient`, which requires additional software. For assistance, visit the Streamlit forums.

ackages.txt` exists in the root directory of your repository we automatically detect it, parse it, and install the listed packages. You can read more about apt-get in [Linux documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get).
Add **apt-get** dependencies to `packages.txt` — one package name per line. For example, [`mysqlclient`](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient) is a Python package which requires additional software be installed to function. A valid `packages.txt` file to enable `mysqlclient` would be:
`  build-essential   pkg-config   default-libmysqlclient-dev `

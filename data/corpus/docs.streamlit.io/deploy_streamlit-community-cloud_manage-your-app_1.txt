You can manage your deployed app from your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) or directly from `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`. You can view, deploy, delete, reboot, or favorite an app.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#manage-your-app-from-your-workspace)Manage your app from your workspace
Streamlit Community Cloud is organized into workspaces, which automatically group your apps according to their repository's owner in GitHub. Your workspace is indicated in the upper-left corner. For more information, see [Switching workspaces](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace#switching-workspaces).
To deploy or manage any app, always switch to the workspace matching the repository's owner first.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#sort-your-apps)Sort your apps
If you have many apps in your workspace, you can pin apps to the top by marking them as favorite (_star_). For more information, see [Favorite your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/favorite-your-app).
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-overflow-menus)App overflow menus
Each app has a menu accessible from the overflow icon (_more_vert_) to the right.

If you need to delete your app, it's simple and easy. There are several cases where you may need to delete your app:
  * You have finished playing around with an example app.
  * You want to deploy from a private repository but already have a private app.
  * You want to [change the Python version](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/upgrade-python) for your app.
  * You want to [rename your repository](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/rename-your-app) or move your entrypoint file.


If you delete your app and intend to immediately redploy it, your custom subdomain should be immediately available for reuse. Read more about data deletion in [Streamlit trust and security](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/trust-and-security#data-deletion).

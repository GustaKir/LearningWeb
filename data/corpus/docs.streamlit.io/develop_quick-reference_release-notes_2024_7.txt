**Other Changes**
  * 🌐 For better app efficiency, a WebSocket reconnect will not trigger a rerun unless a script run was interrupted ([#9083](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9083)).
  * 👋 We updated our `streamlit hello` app to use Google Material icons.
  * ⌨️ `st.number_input`, `st.selectbox`, `st.slider`, `st.select_slider`, and [`st.radio`](http://st.radio) provide more precise type hinting for their return values ([#9048](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9048), [#9296](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9296), [#8717](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8717)). Thanks, [Asaurus1](https://github.com/Asaurus1)!
  * ⭐ [`st.feedback`](http://st.feedback) provides more precise type hinting for its return value ([#9216](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9216)). Thanks, [wyattscarpenter](https://github.com/wyattscarpenter)!
  * 💅 We improved theme management for embedded apps via `postMessage` ([#9103](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9103)).
  * 🌱 Bug fix: Within the sidebar, the image for `st.logo` resizes along with the sidebar width ([#9298](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9298), [#8707](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8707)).
  * 🪹 Bug fix: When a parent fragment updates, Streamlit cleans up child fragments correctly ([#9246](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9246), [#9233](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9233), [#9267](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9267)).
  * 💩 Bug fix: Elements unstale within a fragment rerun as they are updated instead of all together at the end of the fragment rerun ([#9285](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9285)).
  * 🪱 Bug fix: If a block type changes during a rerun, Streamlit discards the child elements of that block to prevent improper visual artifacts, like `st.tabs` causing a blank page ([#9276](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9276), [#9259](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9259), [#8676](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8676)).
  * ☠️ Bug fix: Widget state is preserved when page reruns are interrupted with another rerun ([#9187](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9187), [#9163](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9163)). Thanks, [dannyopts](https://github.com/dannyopts)!
  * 👽 Bug fix: `options` in `st.selectbox`, `st.multiselect`, `st.radio`, and `st.select_slider` correctly use `dict_items` ([#9241](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9241), [#9237](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9237), [#5377](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5377)).
  * 👻 Bug fix: A `SelectboxColumn` index will show with the correct, grayed-out styling in a dataframe ([#9231](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9231), [#8772](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8772)).
  * 🦀 Bug fix: `st.write_stream` will not immediately fail when receiving an empty chunk ([#9234](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9234), [#9227](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9227)).
  * 🦋 Bug fix: Streamlit won't auto-scroll to an empty anchor, if present ([#9206](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9206), [#9203](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9203)).
  * 🦎 Bug fix: We changed the handling of `scriptRunId` to prevent `st.tabs` from showing extra, empty tabs in fragments ([#9186](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9186), [#9158](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9158), [#9215](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9215)).
  * 🐌 Bug fix: Automatically rerunning fragments don't raise `FragmentStorageKeyError` to prevent a possible race condition ([#9183](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9183), [#9080](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9080)).

  * 🦂 Bug fix: We reverted a change to fragments which caused some widgets to lose state in some circumstances ([#9178](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9178), [#9171](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9171)).
  * 🦟 Bug fix: The deprecation warnings for `st.experimental_fragment` and `st.experimental_dialog` only show when the commands are called. This prevents custom components which use them from raising premature warnings on import ([#9170](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9170), [#9143](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9143)).
  * 🦠 Bug fix: `st.code` shows syntax highlighting for diff code when `language="diff"` ([#9172](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9172), [#8687](https://gi

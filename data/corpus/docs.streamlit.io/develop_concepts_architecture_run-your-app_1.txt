Title: Running Your Streamlit App
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app
Summary: This section describes how to run a Streamlit application by integrating Streamlit commands into a Python script. It details the command `streamlit run your_script.py` to launch the app locally, as well as how to pass custom arguments to the script.

# [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app#run-your-streamlit-app)Run your Streamlit app
Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, and then you run it. We list few ways to run your script, depending on your use case.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app#use-streamlit-run)Use streamlit run
Once you've created your script, say `your_script.py`, the easiest way to run it is with `streamlit run`:
`streamlit run your_script.py `
As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app#pass-arguments-to-your-script)Pass arguments to your script
When passing your script some custom arguments, they must be passed after two dashes. Otherwise the arguments get interpreted as arguments to Streamlit itself:
`streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args] `
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app#pass-a-url-to-streamlit-run)Pass a URL to streamlit run
You can also pass a URL to `streamlit run`! This is great when your script is hosted remotely, such as a GitHub Gist. For example:
`streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/master/streamlit_app.py `
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app#run-streamlit-as-a-python-module)Run Streamlit as a Python module
Another way of running Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This is useful when configuring an IDE like PyCharm to work with Streamlit:
`# Running python -m streamlit run your_script.py `
`# is equivalent to: streamlit run your_script.py `

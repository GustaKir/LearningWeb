This page contains release notes for Streamlit versions released in 2019. For the latest version of Streamlit, see [Release notes](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2019#version-0520)Version 0.52.0
_Release date: December 20, 2019_
**Highlights:**
  * üì§ Preview release of the file uploader widget. To try it out just call [`st.file_uploader`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader)!
_Note that as a**preview release** things may change in the near future. Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the API!_
  * üëã Support for [emoji codes](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) in `st.write` and `st.markdown`! Try it out with `st.write("Hello :wave:")`.


**Breaking changes:**
  * üßπ `st.pyplot` now clears figures by default, since that's what you want 99% of the time. This allows you to create two or more Matplotlib charts without having to call [`pyplot.clf`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.clf.html) every time. If you want to turn this behavior off, use [`st.pyplot(clear_figure=False)`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pyplot)
  * üì£ `st.cache` no longer checks for input mutations. This is the first change of our ongoing effort to simplify the caching system and prepare Streamlit for the launch of other caching primitives like Session State!


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2019#version-0510)Version 0.51.0
_Release date: November 30, 2019_
**Highlights:**
  * üêï You can now tweak the behavior of the file watcher with the config option `server.fileWatcherType`. Use it to switch between: 
    * `auto` (default) : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available.
    * `watchdog` : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module.
    * `poll` : Force Streamlit to always use polling.
    * `none` : Streamlit will not watch files.


**Notable bug fixes:**
  * Fix the "keyPrefix" option in static report sharing [#724](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/724)

  * üåÑ You can now set config options using environment variables. For example, `export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=9876`.
  * üê± Ability to call `streamlit run` directly with Github and Gist URLs. No need to grab the "raw" URL first!

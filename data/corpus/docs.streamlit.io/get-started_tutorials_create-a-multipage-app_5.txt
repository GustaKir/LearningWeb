URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app
Summary: This section outlines the final step to run a newly created multipage Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run Hello.py`. It explains that the main page corresponds to the `Hello.py` script and describes the integration of additional pages in the sidebar. The content encourages readers to explore their creativity in developing further apps.

To run your newly converted multipage app, run:
`streamlit run Hello.py `
Thatâ€™s it! The `Hello.py` script now corresponds to the main page of your app, and other scripts that Streamlit finds in the pages folder will also be present in the new page selector that appears in the sidebar.

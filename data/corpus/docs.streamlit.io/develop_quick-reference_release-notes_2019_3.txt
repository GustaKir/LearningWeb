Title: Streamlit Version 0.40.0 Release Notes
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2019
Summary: Released on June 10, 2019, Streamlit version 0.40.0 introduces significant performance improvements, over ten times faster than previous versions. The app execution method has changed to `$ streamlit run your_script.py [script args]`, which now runs a persistent server. This update allows for faster execution as libraries are cached in memory. Using the old method of running scripts will not enable the new performance features.

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2019#version-0400)Version 0.40.0
_Release date: June 10, 2019_
**Highlights:**
  * Streamlit is more than 10x faster. Just save and watch your analyses update instantly.
  * We changed how you run Streamlit apps: `$ streamlit run your_script.py [script args]`
  * Unlike the previous versions of Streamlit, `streamlit run [script] [script args]` creates a server (now you don't need to worry if the proxy is up). To kill the server, all you need to do is hit **Ctrl+c**.


**Why is this so much faster?**
Now, Streamlit keeps a single Python session running until you kill the server. This means that Streamlit can re-run your code without kicking off a new process; imported libraries are cached to memory. An added bonus is that `st.cache` now caches to memory instead of to disk.
**What happens if I run Streamlit the old way?**
If you run `$ python your_script.py` the script will execute from top to bottom, but won't produce a Streamlit app.
**What are the limitations of the new architecture?**
  * To switch Streamlit apps, first you have to kill the Streamlit server with **Ctrl-c**. Then, you can use `streamlit run` to generate the next app.
  * Streamlit only works when used inside Python files, not interactively from the Python REPL.


**What else do I need to know?**
  * The strings we print to the command line when **liveSave** is on have been cleaned up. You may need to adjust any RegEx that depends on those.
  * A number of config options have been renamed:
Old config| New config  
---|---  
proxy.isRemote| server.headless  
proxy.liveSave| server.liveSave  
proxy.runOnSave| server.runOnSave  
proxy.watchFileSystem| server.runOnSave  
proxy.enableCORS| server.enableCORS  
proxy.port| server.port  
browser.proxyAddress| browser.serverAddress  
browser.proxyPort| browser.serverPort  
client.waitForProxySecs|  _n/a_  
client.throttleSecs|  _n/a_  
client.tryToOutliveProxy|  _n/a_  
client.proxyAddress|  _n/a_  
client.proxyPort|  _n/a_  
proxy.autoCloseDelaySecs|  _n/a_  
proxy.reportExpirationSecs|  _n/a_  


**What if something breaks?**
If the new Streamlit isn't working, please let us know by Slack or email. You can downgrade at any time with these commands:
`pip install --upgrade streamlit==0.37 `
`conda install streamlit=0.37 `
**What's next?**
Thank you for staying with us on this journey! This version of Streamlit lays the foundation for interactive widgets, a new feature of Streamlit we're really excited to share with you in the next few months.

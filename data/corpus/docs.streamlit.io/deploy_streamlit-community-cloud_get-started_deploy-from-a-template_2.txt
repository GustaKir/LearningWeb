Title: Understanding Codespace and Community Cloud Deployment
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-from-a-template
Summary: This section emphasizes the distinction between the app in your codespace and the one deployed on Community Cloud. Changes made in codespace remain there until committed to your repository, which then prompts an update on the deployed app. Additional resources are available for further assistance.

#### Important
The app displayed in your codespace is not the same instance you deployed on Community Cloud. Your codespace is a self-contained development environment. When you make edits inside a codespace, those edits don't leave the codespace until you commit them to your repository. When you commit your changes to your repository, Community Cloud detects the changes and updates your deployed app. To learn more, see [Edit your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/edit-your-app).

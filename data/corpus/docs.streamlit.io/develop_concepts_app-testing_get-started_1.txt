This guide will cover a simple example of how tests are structured within a project and how to execute them with `pytest`. After seeing the big picture, keep reading to learn about the [Fundamentals of app testing](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/app-testing/get-started#fundamentals-of-app-testing):
  * Initializing and running a simulated app
  * Retrieving elements
  * Manipulating widgets
  * Inspecting the results

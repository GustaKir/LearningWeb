Summary: This section provides step-by-step instructions for creating a new Snowflake database and using worksheets to execute SQL statements, ideal for learning and experimentation.

If you already have a database that you want to use, you can [skip to the next step](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/snowflake#add-connection-parameters-to-your-local-app-secrets).
  1. Sign in to your Snowflake account at <https://app.snowflake.com>.
  2. In the left navigation, select "**Projects** ," and then select "**Worksheets**."
  3. To create a new worksheet, in the upper-right corner, click the plus icon (_add_).
You can use a worksheet to quickly and conveniently execute SQL statements. This is a great way to learn about and experiment with SQL in a trial account.
  4. Optional: To rename your worksheet, in the upper-left corner, hover over the tab with your worksheet name, and then click the overflow menu icon (_more_vert_). Select "**Rename** ", enter a new worksheet name (e.g. "Scratchwork"), and then press "**Enter** ".
  5. To create a new database with a table, in your worksheet's SQL editor, type and execute the following SQL statements:
`CREATE DATABASE PETS; CREATE TABLE MYTABLE (NAME varchar(80), PET varchar(80)); INSERT INTO MYTABLE VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird'); SELECT * FROM MYTABLE; `
To execute the statements in a worksheet, select all the lines you want to execute by highlighting them with your mouse. Then, in the upper-right corner, click the play button (_play_arrow_). Alternatively, if you want to execute everything in a worksheet, click the down arrow (_expand_more_) next to the play button, and select "**Run All** ".

#### Important
If no lines are highlighted and you click the play button, only the line with your cursor will be executed.
  6. Optional: To view your new database, above the left navigation, select "**Databases**." Click the down arrows (_expand_more_) to expand "PETS" → "PUBLIC" → "Tables" → "MYTABLE."

  7. For your use in later steps, note down your role, warehouse, database, and schema. In the preceding screenshot, these are the following:
`role = "ACCOUNTADMIN" warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH" database = "PETS" schema = "PUBLIC" `
Because the SQL statements did not specify a schema, they defaulted to the "PUBLIC" schema within the new "PETS" database. The role and warehouse are trial-account defaults. You can see the role and warehouse used by your worksheet in the upper-right corner, to the left of the "**Share** " and play (_play_arrow_) buttons.
In Snowflake, databases provide storage, and warehouses provide compute. When you configure your connection, you aren't explicitly required to declare role, warehouse, database, and schema; if these are not specified, the connection will use your account defaults. If you want to use multiple roles, warehouses, or databases, you can also change these settings within an active connection. However, declaring these defaults avoids unintentional selections.
  8. To conveniently copy your account identifier, in the lower-left corner, click your profile image, and hover over your account. A popover dialog expands to the right with your organization and account. In the popover, hover over your account, and click the copy icon (_content_copy_).
The account identifier in your clipboard is period-separated, which is the format used for SQL statements. However, the Snowflake Connector for Python requires a hyphen-separated format. Paste your account identifier into your notes, and change the period to a hyphen.
`account = "xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx" `
For more information, see [Account identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html) in the Snowflake docs.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/snowflake#add-connection-parameters-to-your-local-app-secrets)Add connection parameters to your local app secrets
There are three places Streamlit looks for your connection parameters: keyword arguments in `st.connection`, `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, and `.snowflake/configuration.toml`. For more information, especially if you want to manage multiple connections, see the examples in the API reference for [`SnowflakeConnnection`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.snowflakeconnection).
To configure your connection, you must specify the following:
  * Your account identifier (`account`)
  * Your username (`user`)
  * Some form of authentication parameter (like `password` or `private_key_file`)

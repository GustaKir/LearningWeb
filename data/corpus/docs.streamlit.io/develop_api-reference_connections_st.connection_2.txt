Title: Using Connection Class with Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connection
Summary: This documentation explains how to create a connection in Streamlit using a custom path to a connection class. It provides examples of specifying the connection type in a configuration file and directly importing the connection class for type checking, outlining the necessary code for both methods.

**Example 3: Using a path to the connection class**
Passing the full module path to the connection class can be useful, especially when working with a custom connection. Although this is not the typical way to create first party connections, the following example creates the same type of connection as one with `type="sql"`. Note that `type` is a string path.
`.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```
[connections.my_sql_connection]
url = "xxx+xxx://xxx:xxx@xxx:xxx/xxx"
```

Copy
Your app code:
```
import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection(
  "my_sql_connection", type="streamlit.connections.SQLConnection"
)
```

Copy
**Example 4: Importing the connection class**
You can pass the connection class directly to the `st.connection` command. Doing so allows static type checking tools such as `mypy` to infer the exact return type of `st.connection`. The following example creates the same connection as in Example 3.
`.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```
[connections.my_sql_connection]
url = "xxx+xxx://xxx:xxx@xxx:xxx/xxx"
```

Copy
Your app code:
```
import streamlit as st
from streamlit.connections import SQLConnection
conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type=SQLConnection)
```

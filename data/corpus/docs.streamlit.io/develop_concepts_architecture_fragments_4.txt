Title: Understanding Fragments in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/fragments
Summary: Fragments in Streamlit allow you to run specific parts of your app without executing the entire application. However, they come with limitations such as the inability to detect input changes, unsupported use with caching, and restrictions on widget rendering within external containers.
---

Caching saves you from unnecessarily running a piece of your app while the rest runs. Fragments save you from running your full app when you only want to run one piece.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/fragments#limitations-and-unsupported-behavior)Limitations and unsupported behavior
  * Fragments can't detect a change in input values. It is best to use Session State for dynamic input and output for fragment functions.
  * Using caching and fragments on the same function is unsupported.
  * Fragments can't render widgets in externally-created containers; widgets can only be in the main body of a fragment.

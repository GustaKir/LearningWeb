Title: Understanding the `enumCoercion` Configuration Option
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/custom-classes
Summary: The `enumCoercion` option in Streamlit, enabled by default, allows automatic coercion of widget return values into Enum members when using options from Enum types in widgets like `st.multiselect` or `st.selectbox`. This setting can be controlled via the `config.toml` file and can be adjusted for stricter matching if needed.

That's where the enabled-by-default `enumCoercion` configuration option comes in.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/custom-classes#understanding-the-enumcoercion-configuration-option)Understanding the `enumCoercion` configuration option
When `enumCoercion` is enabled, Streamlit tries to recognize when you are using an element like `st.multiselect` or `st.selectbox` with a set of `Enum` members as options.
If Streamlit detects this, it will convert the widget's returned values to members of the `Enum` class defined in the latest script run. This is something we call automatic `Enum` coercion.
This behavior is [configurable](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration) via the `enumCoercion` setting in your Streamlit `config.toml` file. It is enabled by default, and may be disabled or set to a stricter set of matching criteria.
If you find that you still encounter issues with `enumCoercion` enabled, consider using the [custom class patterns](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/custom-classes#patterns-to-define-your-custom-classes) described above, such as moving your `Enum` class definition to a separate module file.

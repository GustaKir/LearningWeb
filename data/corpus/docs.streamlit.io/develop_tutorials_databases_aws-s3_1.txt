URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3
Summary: This document outlines steps to integrate AWS S3 with Streamlit applications, including creating an S3 bucket, setting up access keys, configuring AWS credentials, and preparing your application requirements. It also details how to write a Streamlit app that utilizes S3 for file storage.

This guide explains how to securely access files on AWS S3 from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses [Streamlit FilesConnection](https://github.com/streamlit/files-connection), the [s3fs](https://github.com/dask/s3fs) library and optionally Streamlit's [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/secrets-management).

#### Note
If you already have a bucket that you want to use, feel free to [skip to the next step](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3#create-access-keys).
First, [sign up for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or log in. Go to the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) and create a new bucket:
![AWS screenshot 1](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/aws-1.png)![AWS screenshot 2](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/aws-2.png)
Navigate to the upload section of your new bucket:
![AWS screenshot 3](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/aws-3.png)![AWS screenshot 4](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/aws-4.png)
And note down the "AWS Region" for later. In this example, it's `us-east-1`, but it may differ for you.
Next, upload the following CSV file, which contains some example data:
[myfile.csv](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/myfile.csv)
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3#create-access-keys)Create access keys
Go to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), create access keys as shown below and copy the "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key":

#### Tip
Access keys created as a root user have wide-ranging permissions. In order to make your AWS account more secure, you should consider creating an IAM account with restricted permissions and using its access keys. More information [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3#set-up-your-aws-credentials-locally)Set up your AWS credentials locally
Streamlit FilesConnection and s3fs will read and use your existing [AWS credentials and configuration](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) if available - such as from an `~/.aws/credentials` file or environment variables.
If you don't already have this set up, or plan to host the app on Streamlit Community Cloud, you should specify the credentials from a file `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your app's root directory or your home directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add to it the access key ID, access key secret, and the AWS default region you noted down earlier, as shown below:
`# .streamlit/secrets.toml AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "xxx" AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "xxx" AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = "xxx" `

#### Important
Be sure to replace `xxx` above with the values you noted down earlier, and add this file to `.gitignore` so you don't commit it to your GitHub repo!
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3#copy-your-app-secrets-to-the-cloud)Copy your app secrets to the cloud
To host your app on Streamlit Community Cloud, you will need to pass your credentials to your deployed app via secrets. Go to the [app dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/) and in the app's dropdown menu, click on **Edit Secrets**. Copy the content of `secrets.toml` above into the text area. More information is available at [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

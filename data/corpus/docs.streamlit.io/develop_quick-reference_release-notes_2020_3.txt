## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0640)Version 0.64.0
_Release date: July 23, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 📊 Default matplotlib to display charts with a tight layout. To disable this, set `bbox_inches` to `None`, inches as a string, or a `Bbox`
  * 🗃 Deprecation warning for automatic encoding on `st.file_uploader`
  * 🙈 If `gatherUserStats` is `False`, do not even load the Segment library. Thanks [@tanmaylaud](https://github.com/tanmaylaud)!


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0630)Version 0.63.0
_Release date: July 13, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 🧩 **Support for Streamlit Components!!!** See [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/streamlit_components.html) for more info.
  * 🕗 Support for datetimes in [`st.slider`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.slider). And, of course, just like any other value you use in `st.slider`, you can also pass in two-element lists to get a datetime range slider.

_Release date: June 21, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 📨 Ability to turn websocket compression on/off via the config option `server.enableWebsocketCompression`. This is useful if your server strips HTTP headers and you do not have access to change that behavior.
  * 🗝️ Out-of-the-box support for CSRF protection using the [Cookie-to-header token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token) technique. This means that if you're serving your Streamlit app from multiple replicas you'll need to configure them to to use the same cookie secret with the `server.cookieSecret` config option. To turn XSRF protection off, set `server.enableXsrfProtection=false`.


**Notable bug fixes:**
  * 🖼️ Added a grace period to the image cache expiration logic in order to fix multiple related bugs where images sent with `st.image` or `st.pyplot` were sometimes missing.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0610)Version 0.61.0
_Release date: June 2, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 📅 Support for date ranges in `st.date_picker`. See [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.date_picker) for more info, but the TLDR is: just pass a list/tuple as the default date and it will be interpreted as a range.
  * 🗣️ You can now choose whether `st.echo` prints the code above or below the output of the echoed block. To learn more, refer to the `code_location` argument in the [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.echo).
  * 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for Keras models and Tensorflow `saved_models`.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0600)Version 0.60.0
_Release date: May 18, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * ↕️ Ability to set the height of an `st.text_area` with the `height` argument (expressed in pixels). See [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.text_area) for more.
  * 🔡 Ability to set the maximimum number of characters allowed in `st.text_area` or `st.text_input`. Check out the `max_chars` argument in the [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.text_area).
  * 🗺️ Better DeckGL support for the [H3](https://h3geo.org/) geospatial indexing system. So now you can use things like `H3HexagonLayer` in [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart).
  * 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for PyTorch TensorBase and Model.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0590)Version 0.59.0
_Release date: May 05, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 🎨 New color-picker widget! Use it with [`st.beta_color_picker()`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.69.0/api.html#streamlit.beta_color_picker)
  * 🧪 Introducing `st.beta_*` and `st.experimental_*` function prefixes, for faster Streamlit feature releases. See [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#pre-release-features) for more info.
  * 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for SQL Alchemy objects, CompiledFFI, PyTorch Tensors, and `builtins.mappingproxy`.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0580)Version 0.58.0
_Release date: April 22, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * 💼 Made `st.selectbox` filtering case-insensitive.
  * ㈬ Better support for Tensorflow sessions in `@st.cache`.
  * 📊 Changed behavior of `st.pyplot` to auto-clear the figure only when using the global Matplotlib figure (i.e. only when calling `st.pyplot()` rather than `st.pyplot(fig)`).

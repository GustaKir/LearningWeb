  1. Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.
It can take several minutes to fully initialize your codespace. After the Visual Studio Code editor appears in your codespace, it can take several minutes to install Python and start the Streamlit server. When complete, a split screen view displays a code editor on the left and a running app on the right. The code editor opens two tabs by default: the repository's readme file and the app's entrypoint file.

  2. Go to the app's entrypoint file (`streamlit_app.py`) in the left pane, and change line 3 by adding "Streamlit" inside `st.title`.
`-st.title("ðŸŽˆ My new app") +st.title("ðŸŽˆ My new Streamlit app") `
Files are automatically saved in your codespace with each edit.
  3. A moment after typing a change, your app on the right side will display a rerun prompt. Click "**Always rerun**."

If the rerun prompt disappears before you click it, you can hover over the overflow menu icon (_more_vert_) to bring it back.
  4. Optional: Continue to make edits and observe the changes within seconds.

When you stop interacting with your codespace, GitHub will generally stop your codespace for you. However, the surest way to avoid undesired use of your capacity is to stop or delete your codespace when you are done.
  1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (_more_horiz_) for your codespace.


![Stop or delete your GitHub Codespace](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-hello-codespace-manage.png)
  1. If you want to return to your work later, click "**Stop codespace**." Otherwise, click "**Delete**."

  2. Congratulations! You just deployed an app to Streamlit Community Cloud. ðŸŽ‰ Return to your workspace at [share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/) and [deploy another Streamlit app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app).

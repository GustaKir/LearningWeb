If you need to clear your app's memory or force a fresh build after modifying a file that Streamlit Community Cloud doesn't monitor, you may need to reboot your app. This will interrupt any user who may currently be using your app and may take a few minutes for your app to redeploy. Anyone visiting your app will see "Your app is in the oven" during a reboot.
Rebooting your app on Community Cloud is easy! You can reboot your app:
  * [From your workspace](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/reboot-your-app#reboot-your-app-from-your-workspace).
  * [From your Cloud logs](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/reboot-your-app#reboot-your-app-from-your-cloud-logs).

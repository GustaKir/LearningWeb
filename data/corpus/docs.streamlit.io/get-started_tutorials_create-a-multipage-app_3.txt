Title: Creating the Entrypoint File for a Streamlit Multipage App
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app
Summary: This section guides you through creating the entrypoint file for a Streamlit multipage application, highlighting the use of `Hello.py`. It provides code snippets to set the page configuration, display welcome messages, and offers links to resources for further exploration of Streamlit's capabilities.

Now, letâ€™s walk through each step of the process and view the corresponding changes in code.

`Hello.py`
`import streamlit as st st.set_page_config(   page_title="Hello",   page_icon="ðŸ‘‹", ) st.write("# Welcome to Streamlit! ðŸ‘‹") st.sidebar.success("Select a demo above.") st.markdown( """   Streamlit is an open-source app framework built specifically for   Machine Learning and Data Science projects.   **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a demo from the sidebar** to see some examples   of what Streamlit can do!   ### Want to learn more?   - Check out [streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)   - Jump into our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io)   - Ask a question in our [community     forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io)   ### See more complex demos   - Use a neural net to [analyze the Udacity Self-driving Car Image     Dataset](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving)   - Explore a [New York City rideshare dataset](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups) """ ) `
We rename our entrypoint file to `Hello.py` , so that the title in the sidebar is capitalized and only the code for the intro page is included. Additionally, weâ€™re able to customize the page title and favicon â€” as it appears in the browser tab with `st.set_page_config`. We can do so for each of our pages too!

Notice how the sidebar does not contain page labels as we havenâ€™t created any pages yet.

A few things to remember here:
  1. We can change the ordering of pages in our MPA by adding numbers to the beginning of each Python file. If we add a 1 to the front of our file name, Streamlit will put that file first in the list.
  2. The name of each Streamlit app is determined by the file name, so to change the app name you need to change the file name!
  3. We can add some fun to our app by adding emojis to our file names that will render in our Streamlit app.
  4. Each page will have its own URL, defined by the name of the file.

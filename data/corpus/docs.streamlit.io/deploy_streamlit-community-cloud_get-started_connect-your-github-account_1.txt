# [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#connect-your-github-account)Connect your GitHub account
Connecting GitHub to your Streamlit Community Cloud account allows you to deploy apps directly from the files you store in your repositories. It also lets the system check for updates to those files and automatically update your apps. When you first connect your GitHub account to your Community Cloud account, you'll be able to deploy apps from your public repositories to Community Cloud. If you want to deploy from private repositories, you can give Community Cloud additional permissions to do so. For more information about these permissions, see [GitHub OAuth scope](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/status#github-oauth-scope).

#### Important
In order to deploy an app, you must have **admin** permissions to its repository. If you don't have admin access, contact the repository's owner or fork the repository to create your own copy. For more help, see our [community forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io/).
If you are a member of a GitHub organization, that organization is displayed at the bottom of each GitHub OAuth prompt. In this case, we recommend reading about [Organization access](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#organization-access) at the end of this page before performing the steps to connect your GitHub account. You must be an organization's owner in GitHub to grant access to that organization.

This adds the "Streamlit" OAuth application to your GitHub account. This allows Community Cloud to work with your public repositories and create codespaces for you. In the next section, you can allow Community Cloud to access your private repositories, too. For more information about using and reviewing the OAuth applications on your account, see [Using OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps) in GitHub's docs.

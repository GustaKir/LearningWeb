Title: Sharing Your Deployed Streamlit App
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app
Summary: Once your app is deployed, you can share it via a fixed URL. The app's permissions mirror those of your GitHub repo. You can only have one private app at a time, and only developers can change its status between public and private.

Now that your app is deployed you can easily share it and collaborate on it. But first, let's take a moment and do a little joy dance for getting that app deployed! ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ
Your app is now live at a fixed URL, so go wild and share it with whomever you want. Your app will inherit permissions from your GitHub repo, meaning that if your repo is private your app will be private and if your repo is public your app will be public. If you want to change that you can simply do so from the app settings menu.
You are only allowed one private app at a time. If you've deployed from a private repository, you will have to make that app public or delete it before you can deploy another app from a private repository. Only developers can change your app between public and private.

If you deployed your app from a public repository, your app will be public by default. If you deployed your app from a private repository, you will need to make the app public if you want to freely share it with the community at large.

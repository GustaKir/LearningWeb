Dependencies within Python can be upgraded in place by simply changing your environment configuration file (typically `requirements.txt`). However, Python itself can't be changed after deployment.
When you deploy an app, you can select the version of Python through the "**Advanced settings** " dialog. After you have deployed an app, you must delete it and redeploy it to change the version of Python it uses.
  1. Take note of your app's settings:
     * Current, custom subdomain.
     * GitHub coordinates (repository, branch, and entrypoint file path).
     * Secrets.
When you delete an app, its custom subdomain is immediately available for reuse.
  2. [Delete your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/delete-your-app).
  3. [Deploy your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app).
    1. On the deployment page, select your app's GitHub coordinates.
    2. Set your custom domain to match your deleted instance.
    3. Click "**Advanced settings**."
    4. Choose your desired version of Python.
    5. Optional: If your app had secrets, re-enter them.
    6. Click "**Save**."
    7. Click "**Deploy**."


In a few minutes, Community Cloud will redirect you to your redployed app.

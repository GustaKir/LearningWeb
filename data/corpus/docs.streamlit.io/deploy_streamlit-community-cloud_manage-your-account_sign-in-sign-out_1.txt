#### Important
When you sign in with GitHub, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses the same email you have on your GitHub account. If such an account doesn't exist, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses your GitHub account for source control. In this latter instance, Community Cloud will update the email on your Community Cloud account to match the email on your GitHub account.

Title: Streamlit Configuration: config.toml Overview
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml
Summary: `config.toml` is an optional configuration file for Streamlit that can be defined in either a working directory or globally. When both are defined, the working directory's configuration takes precedence. Users can also override settings using environment variables and command-line options. The configuration file should be placed in the `.streamlit` directory within the working directory.

`config.toml` is an optional file you can define for your working directory or global development environment. When `config.toml` is defined both globally and in your working directory, Streamlit combines the configuration options and gives precedence to the working-directory configuration. Additionally, you can use environment variables and command-line options to override additional configuration options. For more information, see [Configuration options](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options).
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#file-location)File location
To define your configuration locally or per-project, add `.streamlit/config.toml` to your working directory. Your working directory is wherever you call `streamlit run`. If you haven't previously created the `.streamlit` directory, you will need to add it.
To define your configuration globally, you must first locate your global `.streamlit` directory. Streamlit adds this hidden directory to your OS user profile during installation. For MacOS/Linux, this will be `~/.streamlit/config.toml`. For Windows, this will be `%userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml`.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#file-format)File format
`config.toml` is a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file.

Below are all the sections and options you can have in your `.streamlit/config.toml` file. To see all configurations, use the following command in your terminal or CLI:

`[global] # By default, Streamlit displays a warning when a user sets both a widget # default value in the function defining the widget and a widget value via # the widget's key in `st.session_state`. # If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True. # Default: false disableWidgetStateDuplicationWarning = false # If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script # via "python my_script.py". # Default: true showWarningOnDirectExecution = true `
#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#logger)Logger
`[logger] # Level of logging for Streamlit's internal logger: "error", "warning", # "info", or "debug". # Default: "info" level = "info" # String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, # logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. # See Python's documentation for available attributes: # https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#formatter-objects # Default: "%(asctime)s %(message)s" messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(message)s" `

_Release date: Oct 5, 2021_
**Highlights**
  * 🎈Announcing Streamlit 1.0! To read more about check out our [1.0 blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/announcing-streamlit-1-0/).


**Other Changes**
  * 🐞 Fixed an issue where using `df.dtypes` to show datatypes for a DF fails while using Arrow ([#3709](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3709)), Image captions stay within image width and are readable ([#3530](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3530)).


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2021#version-0890)Version 0.89.0
_Release date: Sep 22, 2021_
**Highlights**
  * 💰 Introducing `st.experimental_memo` and `experimental_singleton`, a new primitive for caching! See [our blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/new-experimental-primitives-for-caching/).
  * 🍔 Streamlit allows developers to configure their hamburger menu to be more user-centric.


**Notable Changes**
  * 💅 We updated our UI to a more polished look with a new font.
  * 🎨 We now support `theme.base` in the theme object when it's sent to custom components.
  * 🧠 We've modified session state to reset widgets if any of their arguments changed even if they provide a key. 
    * Some widget behavior may have changed, but we believe this change makes the most sense. We have added a section to [our documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/widget-semantics) describing how they behave.


**Other Changes**
  * 🐞 Bug fixes: Support svgs from a URL ([#3809](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3809)) and that do not start with `<svg>` tag ([#3789](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3789)).

_Release date: Sep 2, 2021_
**Highlights**
  * ⬇️ Introducing `st.download_button`, a new button widget for easily downloading files.


**Notable Changes**
  * 🛑 We made changes to improve the redacted exception experience on Streamlit Community Cloud. When `client.showErrorDetails=true` exceptions display the Error Type and the Traceback, but redact the actual error text to prevent data leaks.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2021#version-0870)Version 0.87.0
_Release date: Aug 19, 2021_

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2021#version-0860)Version 0.86.0
_Release date: Aug 5, 2021_
**Highlights**
  * 🎓 Our layout primitives are graduating from beta! You can now use `st.columns`, `st.container` and `st.expander` without the `beta_` prefix.


**Notable Changes**
  * 📱 When using `st.columns`, columns will stack vertically when viewport size <640px so that column layout on smaller viewports is consistent and cleaner. ([#3594](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3594)).

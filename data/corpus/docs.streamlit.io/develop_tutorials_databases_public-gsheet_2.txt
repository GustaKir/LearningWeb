This tutorial assumes a local Streamlit app, however you can also connect to Google Sheets from apps hosted in Community Cloud. The main additional steps are:
  * [Include information about dependencies](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/app-dependencies) using a `requirements.txt` file with `st-gsheets-connection` and any other dependencies.
  * [Add your secrets](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management) to your Community Cloud app.

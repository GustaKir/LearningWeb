URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/authentication/microsoft

When you are ready to deploy your app, you must update your application in Microsoft Azure and your secrets. The following steps describe how to deploy your app on Community Cloud.
  1. Add a `requirements.txt` file to your repository with the following lines:
`streamlit>=1.42.0 Authlib>=1.3.2 `
This ensures that the correct Python dependencies are installed for your deployed app.
  2. Save your `requirements.txt` file.
  3. Deploy your app, and copy your app's URL into your text editor.
You'll use your app's URL to update your secrets and application configuration in the following steps. For more information about deploying an app on Community Cloud, see [Deploy your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app).
  4. In your [app settings](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/app-settings) in Community Cloud, select "**Secrets**."
  5. Copy the contents of your local `secrets.toml` file, and paste them into your app settings.
  6. Change your `redirect_uri` to reflect your deployed app's URL.
For example, if your app is `my_streamlit_app.streamlit.io`, your redirect URI would be `https://my_streamlit_app.streamlit.io/oauth2callback`.
  7. Save and close your settings.
  8. Return to your application in Microsoft Azure.
If you've closed Microsoft Azure and need to navigate back to your application, go to your Azure portal → Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations, and select it from the list.
  9. In the left navigation, select "**Authentication**."
  10. Under "Platform configurations" → "Web," add or update a URI to match your new `redirect_uri`.
  11. At the bottom of the page, select "**Save**."
  12. Open your deployed app, and test it.

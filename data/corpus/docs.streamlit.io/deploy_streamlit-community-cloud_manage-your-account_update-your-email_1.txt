URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email
Summary: This section explains how to change your email address in Streamlit Community Cloud by merging accounts or using a GitHub account. It details the steps for updating your GitHub email and signing into Community Cloud to verify the email change.
---

Your old and new accounts are now merged, and you have effectively changed your email address.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email#option-2-use-your-github-account)Option 2: Use your GitHub account
Alternatively, you can change the email on your GitHub account and then sign in to Community Cloud with GitHub.
  1. Go to GitHub, and set your primary email address to your new email.
  2. If you are currently signed in to Community Cloud, sign out.
  3. Sign in to Community Cloud _using GitHub_.
If you are redirected to your workspace and you see your existing apps, you're done! Your email has been changed. To confirm your current email and GitHub account, click on your workspace name in the upper-left corner, and look at the bottom of the drop-down menu.
If you are redirected to an empty workspace and you see "**Workspaces _warning_** " in the upper-left corner, proceed to [Connect your GitHub account](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account). This can happen if you previously created an account with your new email but didn't connect a GitHub account to it.

#### Important
If you have multiple GitHub accounts, be careful. To avoid unexpected behavior, either use unique emails on each GitHub account or avoid signing in to Community Cloud using GitHub.

Title: Streamlit Configuration Options
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options
Summary: This section outlines the available configuration options for Streamlit, detailing how to declare them in the `config.toml` file, as environment variables, or through command line options. It explains the format for converting variable names for environment use and provides examples for both environment variables and command line options.

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options#available-options)Available options
All available configuration options are documented in [`config.toml`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml). These options may be declared in a TOML file, as environment variables, or as command line options.
When using environment variables to override `config.toml`, convert the variable (including its section header) to upper snake case and add a `STREAMLIT_` prefix. For example, `STREAMLIT_CLIENT_SHOW_ERROR_DETAILS` is equivalent to the following in TOML:
`[client] showErrorDetails = true `
When using command line options to override `config.toml` and environment variables, use the same case as you would in the TOML file and include the section header as a period-separated prefix. For example, the command line option `--server.enableStaticServing true` is equivalent to the following:
`[server] enableStaticServing = true `
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options#telemetry)Telemetry
As mentioned during the installation process, Streamlit collects usage statistics. You can find out more by reading our [Privacy Notice](https://streamlit.io/privacy-policy), but the high-level summary is that although we collect telemetry data we cannot see and do not store information contained in Streamlit apps.
If you'd like to opt out of usage statistics, add the following to your config file:
`[browser] gatherUsageStats = false `
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options#theming)Theming
You can change the base colors of your app using the `[theme]` section of the configuration system. To learn more, see [Theming.](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/theming)
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/options#view-all-configuration-options)View all configuration options
As described in [Command-line options](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/cli), you can view all available configuration options using:
`streamlit config show `

Title: Streamlit Configuration: Runner Settings
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml
Summary: This section outlines the configuration options related to the runner in Streamlit. Key settings include enabling single-line variable input (`magicEnabled`), immediate handling of script rerun requests for enhanced responsiveness (`fastReruns`), and the default behaviors for these options.

`[runner] # Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of # Python code to write it to the app. # Default: true magicEnabled = true # Handle script rerun requests immediately, rather than waiting for script # execution to reach a yield point. This makes Streamlit much more # responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in # apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state # assignment statements. # Default: true fastReruns = true # Raise an exception after adding unserializable data to Session State. # Some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session # State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, # or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future. # Default: false enforceSerializableSessionState = false # Adjust how certain 'options' widgets like radio, selectbox, and # multiselect coerce Enum members when the Enum class gets re-defined # during a script re-run. For more information, check out the docs: # https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/custom-classes#enums # Allowed values: # - "off"     : Disables Enum coercion. # - "nameOnly"   : Enum classes can be coerced if their member names match. # - "nameAndValue" : Enum classes can be coerced if their member names AND #          member values match. # Default: "nameOnly" enumCoercion = "nameOnly" `

`[server] # List of folders that should not be watched for changes. # Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory. # Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder'] # Default: [] folderWatchBlacklist = [] # Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off # completely. # Allowed values: # - "auto"   : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and #        falls back to polling if watchdog is not available. # - "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module. # - "poll"   : Force Streamlit to always use polling. # - "none"   : Streamlit will not watch files. # Default: "auto" fileWatcherType = "auto" # Symmetric key used to produce signed cookies.

The server # may choose to clean up session state, uploaded files, etc for a given session # with no active websocket connection at any point after this time has passed.

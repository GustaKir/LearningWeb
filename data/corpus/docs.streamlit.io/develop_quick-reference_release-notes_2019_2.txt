_Release date: October 12, 2019_
**Highlights:**
  * 🔧 Ability to set config options as command line flags or in a local config file.
  * ↕️ You can now maximize charts and images!
  * ⚡ Streamlit is now much faster when writing data in quick succession to your app.
  * ✳️ Ability to blacklist folder globs from "run on save" and `@st.cache` hashing.
  * 🎛️ Improved handling of widget state when Python file is modified.
  * 🙈 Improved HTML support in `st.write` and `st.markdown`. HTML is still unsafe, though!


**Notable bug fixes:**
  * Fixes `@st.cache` bug related to having your Python environment on current working directory. [Issue #242](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/242)
  * Fixes loading of root url `/` on Windows. [Issue #244](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/244)


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2019#version-0470)Version 0.47.0
_Release date: October 1, 2019_
**Highlights:**
  * 🌄 New hello.py showing off 4 glorious Streamlit apps. Try it out!
  * 🔄 Streamlit now automatically selects an unused port when 8501 is already in use.
  * 🎁 Sidebar support is now out of beta! Just start any command with `st.sidebar.` instead of `st.`
  * ⚡ Performance improvements: we added a cache to our websocket layer so we no longer re-send data to the browser when it hasn't changed between runs
  * 📈 Our "native" charts `st.line_chart`, `st.area_chart` and `st.bar_chart` now use Altair behind the scenes
  * 🔫 Improved widgets: custom st.slider labels; default values in multiselect
  * 🕵️‍♀️ The filesystem watcher now ignores hidden folders and virtual environments
  * 💅 Plus lots of polish around caching and widget state management


**Breaking change:**
  * 🛡️ We have temporarily disabled support for sharing static "snapshots" of Streamlit apps. Now that we're no longer in a limited-access beta, we need to make sure sharing is well thought through and abides by laws like the DMCA. But we're working on a solution!

**Breaking change:**

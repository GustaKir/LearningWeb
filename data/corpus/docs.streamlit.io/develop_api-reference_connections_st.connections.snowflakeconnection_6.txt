Title: SnowflakeConnection.write_pandas Method
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.snowflakeconnection
Summary: The 'write_pandas' method allows users to write a pandas DataFrame to a table in a Snowflake database. It acts as a wrapper around the 'snowflake.connector.pandas_tools.write_pandas()' function, automatically handling the connection parameter. Additional details and options can be found in the Snowflake Connector for Python documentation.

Write a `pandas.DataFrame` to a table in a Snowflake database.
This convenience method is a thin wrapper around `snowflake.connector.pandas_tools.write_pandas()` using the underlying connection. The `conn` parameter is passed automatically. For more information and additional keyword arguments, see the [Snowflake Connector for Python documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-api#write_pandas).
Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.44.0/lib/streamlit/connections/snowflake_connection.py#L373 "View st.write_pandas source code on GitHub")  
---  
SnowflakeConnection.write_pandas(df, table_name, database=None, schema=None, chunk_size=None, **kwargs)  
Parameters  
df (pandas.DataFrame) |  The `pandas.DataFrame` object containing the data to be copied into the table.  
table_name (str) |  Name of the table where the data should be copied to.  
database (str) |  Name of the database containing the table. By default, the function writes to the database that is currently in use in the session. Note If you specify this parameter, you must also specify the schema parameter.  
schema (str) |  Name of the schema containing the table. By default, the function writes to the table in the schema that is currently in use in the session.  
chunk_size (int) |  Number of elements to insert at a time. By default, the function inserts all elements in one chunk.  
**kwargs (Any) |  Additional keyword arguments for `snowflake.connector.pandas_tools.write_pandas()`.  
Returns  
(tuple[bool, int, int]) | A tuple containing three values:
  1. A boolean value that is `True` if the write was successful.
  2. An integer giving the number of chunks of data that were copied.
  3. An integer giving the number of rows that were inserted.

  
#### Example
The following example uses the database and schema currently in use in the session and copies the data into a table named "my_table."
```
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(
  {"Name": ["Mary", "John", "Robert"], "Pet": ["dog", "cat", "bird"]}
)
conn = st.connection("snowflake")
conn.write_pandas(df, "my_table")
```

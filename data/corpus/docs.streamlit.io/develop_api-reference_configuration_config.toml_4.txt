Title: Streamlit Configuration: Security Options and Browser Settings
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml
Summary: This section outlines the configuration options for Streamlit, focusing on security settings for HTTPS connections, including 'disconnectedSessionTTL', 'sslCertFile', and 'sslKeyFile'. It also emphasizes that these SSL options should not be used in production environments without proper termination at a load balancer or reverse proxy. Additionally, it discusses browser settings for designating the internet address for user access to the application.

For the production environment, we # recommend performing SSL termination by the load balancer or the reverse # proxy.'] sslCertFile = # Cryptographic key file for connecting via HTTPS. # Must be set at the same time as "server.sslCertFile". # ['DO NOT USE THIS OPTION IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.

`[browser] # Internet address where users should point their browsers in order to # connect to the app. Can be IP address or DNS name and path. # This is used to: # - Set the correct URL for CORS and XSRF protection purposes. # - Show the URL on the terminal # - Open the browser # Default: "localhost" serverAddress = "localhost" # Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit. # Default: true gatherUsageStats = true # Port where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the # app. # This is used to: # - Set the correct URL for XSRF protection purposes. # - Show the URL on the terminal (part of `streamlit run`). # - Open the browser automatically (part of `streamlit run`). # This option is for advanced use cases. To change the port of your app, use # `server.Port` instead. Don't use port 3000 which is reserved for internal # development. # Default: whatever value is set in server.port. serverPort = 8501 `

`[mapbox] # Configure Streamlit to use a custom Mapbox # token for elements like st.pydeck_chart and st.map. # To get a token for yourself, create an account at # https://mapbox.com. It's free (for moderate usage levels)! # Default: "" token = "" `
#### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#theme)Theme
`[theme] # The preset Streamlit theme that your custom theme inherits from. # This can be one of the following: "light" or "dark". base = # Primary accent color. primaryColor = # Background color of the app. backgroundColor = # Background color used for most interactive widgets. secondaryBackgroundColor = # Color used for almost all text. textColor = # Color used for all links. linkColor = # Background color used for code blocks. codeBackgroundColor = # The font family for all text, except code blocks. This can be one of # the following: # - "sans-serif" # - "serif" # - "monospace" # - the `font` value for a custom font table under [[theme.fontFaces]] # - a comma-separated list of these (as a single string) to specify #  fallbacks # For example, you can use the following: # font = "cool-font, fallback-cool-font, sans-serif" font = # The font family to use for code (monospace) in the sidebar. This can be # one of the following: # - "sans-serif" # - "serif" # - "monospace" # - the `font` value for a custom font table under [[theme.fontFaces]] # - a comma-separated list of these (as a single string) to specify #  fallbacks codeFont = # The font family to use for headings. This can be one of the following: # - "sans-serif" # - "serif" # - "monospace" # - the `font` value for a custom font table under [[theme.fontFaces]] # - a comma-separated list of these (as a single string) to specify #  fallbacks # If no heading font is set, Streamlit uses `theme.font` for headings. headingFont = # An array of fonts to use in your app. Each font in the array is a table # (dictionary) with the following three attributes: font, url, weight, # and style. To host a font with your app, enable static file serving # with `server.enableStaticServing=true`. You can define multiple # [[theme.fontFaces]] tables. # For example, each font is defined in a [[theme.fontFaces]] table as # follows: # [[theme.fontFaces]] # font = "font_name" # url = "app/static/font_file.woff" # weight = 400 # style = "normal" fontFaces = # The radius used as basis for the corners of most UI elements. This can # be one of the following: "none", "small", "medium", "large", "full", # or the number in pixels or rem. For example, you can use "10px", # "0.5rem", or "2rem". To follow best practices, use rem instead of # pixels when specifying a numeric size. baseRadius = # The color of the border around elements. borderColor = # Whether to show a border around input widgets. showWidgetBorder = # Sets the root font size (in pixels) for the app, which determines the # overall scale of text and UI elements. The default base font size is 16. baseFontSize = # Whether to show a vertical separator between the sidebar and the main # content area.

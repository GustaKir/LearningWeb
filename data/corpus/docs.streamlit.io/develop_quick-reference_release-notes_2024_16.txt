**Notable Changes**
  * 📺 You can now pass subtitles to [`st.video`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/media/st.video)! Check out our [feature demo](https://doc-video-subtitle-inputs.streamlit.app/).
  * ⚗️ [`AppTest`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/app-testing/st.testing.v1.apptest) includes support for `st.expander` and `st.status`.
  * 🧪 [`AppTest.from_function`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/app-testing/st.testing.v1.apptest#apptestfrom_function) accepts a function that takes arguments and/or returns a value.
  * 🧩 The timeout warning for custom components was replaced with an element skeleton to improve the UX for slow-loading components, especially in some cloud-hosted platforms ([#8179](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/8179), [#7046](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7046)).
  * 📄 `st.switch_page` and `st.page_link` received significant improvements to path handling, performance, and visual appearance (see below for details).
  * 🦀 Bug fix: Streamlit uses `glide-data-grid` version 6.0.4 to fix a variety of dataframe issues ([#7779](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/7779), [#6900](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6900), [#7032](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7032), [#7727](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7727), [#6810](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6810), [#7930](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7930), [#7949](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7949), [#7831](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7831), [#8168](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8168)).
  * 💦 Bug fix: We've plugged a significant memory leak in the coroutine loop. Apps that generate a large number of small messages between client and server will benefit greatly ([#8068](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/8068), [#7989](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7989), [#6510](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6510)).

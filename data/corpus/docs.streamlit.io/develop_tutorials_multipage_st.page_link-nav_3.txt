Title: Role-Based Access Control in Streamlit Multipage Apps
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/multipage/st.page_link-nav
Summary: This section outlines how to implement role-based access control in a Streamlit multipage application. It provides examples of `admin.py` and `super-admin.py` pages where the user's role is verified against a whitelist. If the user's role is not permitted, a warning is displayed and the app halts using `st.stop`, ensuring only authorized users access certain pages.
---

ractice to include a check of the role at the top of each restricted page. You can use `st.stop` to halt an app if a role is not whitelisted.
`pages/admin.py`:
`import streamlit as st from menu import menu_with_redirect # Redirect to app.py if not logged in, otherwise show the navigation menu menu_with_redirect() # Verify the user's role if st.session_state.role not in ["admin", "super-admin"]:   st.warning("You do not have permission to view this page.")   st.stop() st.title("This page is available to all admins") st.markdown(f"You are currently logged with the role of {st.session_state.role}.") `
`pages/super-admin.py`:
`import streamlit as st from menu import menu_with_redirect # Redirect to app.py if not logged in, otherwise show the navigation menu menu_with_redirect() # Verify the user's role if st.session_state.role not in ["super-admin"]:   st.warning("You do not have permission to view this page.")   st.stop() st.title("This page is available to super-admins") st.markdown(f"You are currently logged with the role of {st.session_state.role}.") `
As noted above, the redirect in `menu_with_redirect()` will prevent a user from ever seeing the warning messages on the admin pages. If you want to see the warning, just add another `st.page_link("pages/admin.py")` button at the bottom of `app.py` so you can navigate to the admin page after selecting the "user" role. ðŸ˜‰

It also mentions that developers can customize the messages shown in the 'About' section using 'st.set_page_config'.

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#about)About
You can conveniently check what version of Streamlit is running from the "**About** " option. Developers also have the option to customize the message shown here using [`st.set_page_config`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#developer-options)Developer options
By default, developer options only show when viewing an app locally or when viewing a Community Cloud app while logged in with administrative permission. You can [customize the menu](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#customize-the-menu) if you want to make these options available for all users.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#clear-cache)Clear cache
Reset your app's cache by clicking "**Clear cache** " from the app's menu or by pressing "**C** " on your keyboard while not focused on an input element. This will remove all cached entries for [`@st.cache_data`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.cache_data) and [`@st.cache_resource`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.cache_resource).
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#deploy-this-app)Deploy this app
If you are running an app locally from within a git repo, you can deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud in a few easy clicks! Make sure your work has been pushed to your online GitHub repository before beginning. For the greatest convenience, make sure you have already created your [Community Cloud account](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/create-your-account) and are signed in.
  1. Click "**Deploy** " next to the app menu icon (_more_vert_).


![Settings](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/app-menu/app-menu-deploy.png)
  1. Click "**Deploy now**."


![Settings](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/app-menu/app-menu-deploy-1.png)
  1. You will be taken to Community Cloud's "Deploy an app" page. Your app's repository, branch, and file name will be prefilled to match your current app! Learn more about [deploying an app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app) on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome#customize-the-menu)Customize the menu
Using `client.toolbarMode` in your app's [configuration](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration), you can make the app menu appear in the following ways:
  * `"developer"` — Show the developer options to all viewers.
  * `"viewer"` — Hide the developer options from all viewers.
  * `"minimal"` — Show only those options set externally. These options can be declared through [`st.set_page_config`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config) or populated through Streamlit Community Cloud.
  * `"auto"` — This is the default and will show the developer options when accessed through localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud when logged into an administrative account for the app. Otherwise, the developer options will not show.

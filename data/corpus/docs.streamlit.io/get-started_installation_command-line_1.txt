Title: Installing Streamlit Using Command Line
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line
Summary: This document provides a guide on how to set up a Python environment using `venv` and install Streamlit with `pip`. It includes prerequisites, such as having Python 3.9 to 3.13 installed. The guide concludes with building a simple 'Hello world' app, while also mentioning the Anaconda Distribution as an alternative for managing Python environments.

This page will walk you through creating an environment with `venv` and installing Streamlit with `pip`. These are our recommended tools, but if you are familiar with others you can use your favorite ones too. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. If you prefer to have a graphical interface to manage your Python environments, check out how to [Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line#prerequisites)Prerequisites
As with any programming tool, in order to install Streamlit you first need to make sure your computer is properly set up. More specifically, you’ll need:
  1. **Python**
We support [version 3.9 to 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. **A Python environment manager** (recommended)
Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between projects.
We recommend using virtual environments because installing or upgrading a Python package may cause unintentional effects on another package. For a detailed introduction to Python environments, check out [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).
For this guide, we'll be using `venv`, which comes with Python.
  3. **A Python package manager**
Package managers handle installing each of your Python packages, including Streamlit.
For this guide, we'll be using `pip`, which comes with Python.
  4. **Only on MacOS: Xcode command line tools**
Download Xcode command line tools using [these instructions](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4.html) in order to let the package manager install some of Streamlit's dependencies.
  5. **A code editor**
Our favorite editor is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is also what we use in all our tutorials.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line#create-an-environment-using-venv)Create an environment using `venv`
  1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.
`cd myproject `
  2. In your terminal, type:
`python -m venv .venv `
  3. A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line#activate-your-environment)Activate your environment
  1. In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.
`# Windows command prompt .venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows PowerShell .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # macOS and Linux source .venv/bin/activate `
  2. Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line#install-streamlit-in-your-environment)Install Streamlit in your environment
  1. In the terminal with your environment activated, type:
`pip install streamlit `
  2. Test that the installation worked by launching the Streamlit Hello example app:
`streamlit hello `
If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:
`python -m streamlit hello `
  3. Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

  4. Close your terminal when you are done.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line#create-a-hello-world-app-and-run-it)Create a "Hello World" app and run it
  1. Create a file named `app.py` in your project folder.


`import streamlit as st st.write("Hello world") `
  1. Any time you want to use your new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the `.venv` directory lives) and run the command to activate it:


`# Windows command prompt .venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows PowerShell .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # macOS and Linux source .venv/bin/activate `
  1. Once activated, you will see your environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt. "(.venv)"
  2. Run your Streamlit app.


`streamlit run app.py `
If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:
`python -m streamlit run app.py `
  1. To stop the Streamlit server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
  2. When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:

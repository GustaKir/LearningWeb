Title: Streamlit ExperimentalBaseConnection Documentation
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.experimentalbaseconnection
Summary: This document provides an overview of the `st.connections.ExperimentalBaseConnection` class, part of Streamlit's experimental features. It includes a warning about the potential changes to experimental APIs and suggests visiting another page for more comprehensive information on managing data connections in Streamlit apps.

#### Deprecation notice
`st.connections.ExperimentalBaseConnection` was deprecated in version 1.28.0. Use [`st.connections.BaseConnection`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.baseconnection) instead.
The abstract base class that all Streamlit Connections must inherit from.
This base class provides connection authors with a standardized way to hook into the `st.connection()` factory function: connection authors are required to provide an implementation for the abstract method `_connect` in their subclasses.
Additionally, it also provides a few methods/properties designed to make implementation of connections more convenient. See the docstrings for each of the methods of this class for more information
Note
While providing an implementation of `_connect` is technically all that's required to define a valid connection, connections should also provide the user with context-specific ways of interacting with the underlying connection object. For example, the first-party SQLConnection provides a `query()` method for reads and a `session` property for more complex operations.

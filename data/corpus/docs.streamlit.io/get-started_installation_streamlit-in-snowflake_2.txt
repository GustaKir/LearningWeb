## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake#create-a-hello-world-streamlit-app)Create a "Hello World" Streamlit app
  1. In the left navigation, select "**Projects** " → "**Streamlit**."
  2. In the upper-right corner, click the blue "_add_ **Streamlit App** " button.
  3. Enter your app details as follows:
     * App title: "Hello World"
     * App location: "STREAMLIT_DB" and "PUBLIC"
     * App warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH" (default) or "STREAMLIT_WH" (if you created a new warehouse)
If you can't select your database, refresh the page to ensure that the interface is displaying current information.
  4. Click "**Create**." (Note that the app will run with the rights of "ACCOUNTADMIN" for simplicity. You can curate your roles and permissions to choose who can create and access apps.)

Your new app is prefilled with example code and opens in editing mode. The left panel shows your code. The right panel shows the resulting app.
  5. Optional: Explore the example app.
  6. In the left code editor, delete everything, and replace it with the following:
`import streamlit as st st.write("Hello World") `
If you want to return to the sample code later, you can always make another app to edit the same example again.
  7. In the upper-right corner, click the blue "_play_arrow_ **Run** " button to make the running app reflect your changes.
Hooray! You just wrote a Streamlit app.

#### Tip
In the lower-left corner of the editing interface, you can click the splitscreen icons to toggle the visibility of your file navigation, code editor, and app preview.
  8. Change `st.write` to `st.title`:
`import streamlit as st st.title("Hello World") `
  9. In the upper-right corner, click the blue "_play_arrow_ **Run** " button to make the running app reflect your changes.
Your app now displays the larger title text.
  10. Optional: Make more edits to your app. You must interact with your app or click the blue "_play_arrow_ **Run** " button to display the changes. This is different from a local environment where you can save your changes to trigger a rerun.
  11. To return to Snowsight, in the upper-left corner, click "_chevron_left_ **Streamlit Apps**."

When you want to view or edit your app again, you can return to it through Snowsight. If you are returning to the site, you can sign in at [app.snowflake.com](https://app.snowflake.com/).
  1. In the left navigation, select "**Projects** " → "**Streamlit**."
  2. In your list of apps, click "**Hello World**."
If you don't see your app, check that your role is set to "ACCOUNTADMIN" as described in [Optional: Create a warehouse](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake#optional-create-a-warehouse).
  3. Your app will open in viewing mode. To edit your app, in the upper-right corner, click "**Edit**."

Read about our [Basic concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) and try out more commands in your app. Or, create more apps in Snowflake! You can reuse your warehouse and database, so you don't need to repeat those steps.

Embedding Streamlit Community Cloud apps enriches your content by integrating interactive, data-driven applications directly within your pages. Whether you're writing a blog post, a technical document, or sharing resources on platforms like Medium, Notion, or even StackOverflow, embedding Streamlit apps adds a dynamic component to your content. This allows your audience to interact with your ideas, rather than merely reading about them or looking at screenshots.
Streamlit Community Cloud supports both [iframe](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app#embedding-with-iframes) and [oEmbed](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app#embedding-with-oembed) methods for embedding **public** apps. This flexibility enables you to share your apps across a wide array of platforms, broadening your app's visibility and impact. In this guide, we'll cover how to use both methods effectively to share your Streamlit apps with the world.

Streamlit Community Cloud supports embedding **public** apps using the subdomain scheme. To embed a public app, add the query parameter `/?embed=true` to the end of the `*.streamlit.app` URL.
For example, say you want to embed the [30DaysOfStreamlit app](https://30days.streamlit.app/). The URL to include in your iframe is: `https://30days.streamlit.app/?embed=true`:
`<iframe  src="https://30days.streamlit.app?embed=true"  style="height: 450px; width: 100%;" ></iframe> `

#### Important
There will be no official support for embedding private apps.
In addition to allowing you to embed apps via iframes, the `?embed=true` query parameter also does the following:
  * Removes the toolbar with the app menu icon (_more_vert_).
  * Removes the padding at the top and bottom of the app.
  * Removes the footer.
  * Removes the colored line from the top of the app.


For granular control over the embedding behavior, Streamlit allows you to specify one or more instances of the `?embed_options` query parameter (e.g. to show the toolbar, open the app in dark theme, etc).

Streamlit's oEmbed support allows for a simpler embedding experience. You can directly drop a Streamlit app's URL into a Medium, Ghost, or Notion page (or any of more than 700 content providers that supports oEmbed or [embed.ly](https://embed.ly/)). The embedded app will automatically appear! This helps Streamlit Community Cloud apps seamlessly integrate into these platforms, improving the visibility and accessibility of your apps.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app#example)Example
When creating content in a Notion page, Medium article, or Ghost blog, you only need to paste the app's URL and hit "**Enter**." The app will then render automatically at that spot in your content. You can use your undecorated app URL without the `?embed=true` query parameter.
`https://30days.streamlit.app/ `
Here's an example of [@chrieke](https://github.com/chrieke)'s [Prettymapp app](https://chrieke-prettymapp-streamlit-prettymappapp-1k0qxh.streamlit.app/) embedded in a Medium article:

#### Tip
Ensure the platform hosting the embedded Streamlit app supports oEmbed or [embed.ly](https://embed.ly/).

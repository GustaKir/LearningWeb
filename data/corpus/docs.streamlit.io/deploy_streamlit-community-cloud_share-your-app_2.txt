### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app#invite-viewers-by-email)Invite viewers by email
Whether your app is public or private, you can send an email invite to your app directly from Streamlit Community Cloud. This grants the viewer access to analytics for all your public apps and the ability to invite other viewers to your workspace. Developers and invited viewers are identified by their email in analytics instead of appearing anonymously (if they view any of your apps while signed in). Read more about viewers in [App analytics](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/app-analytics).
  1. From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, click "**Share** " in the upper-right corner.
  2. Enter an email address and click "**Invite**."

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app#add-a-badge-to-your-github-repository)Add a badge to your GitHub repository
To help others find and play with your Streamlit app, you can add Streamlit's GitHub badge to your repo. Below is an enlarged example of what the badge looks like. Clicking on the badge takes you toâ€”in this caseâ€”Streamlit's Roadmap.
[![Open in Streamlit badge for GitHub](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/streamlit-community-cloud/github-badge.svg)](https://roadmap.streamlit.app/)
Once you deploy your app, you can embed this badge right into your GitHub README.md by adding the following Markdown:
`[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app) `

#### Note
Be sure to replace `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app` with the URL of your deployed app!
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app#share-your-private-app)Share your private app
By default an app deployed from a private repository will be private to the developers in the workspace. A private app will not be visible to anyone else unless you grant them explicit permission. You can grant permission by adding them as a developer on GitHub or by adding them as a viewer on Streamlit Community Cloud.
Once you have added someone's email address to your app's viewer list, that person will be able to sign in and view your private app. If their email is associated with a Google account, they will be able to sign in with Google OAuth. Otherwise, they will be able to sign in with single-use, emailed links. Streamlit sends an email invitation with a link to your app every time you invite someone.

#### Important
When you add a viewer to any app in your workspace, they are granted access to analytics for that app as well as analytics for all your public apps. They can also pass these permissions to others by inviting more viewers. All viewers and developers in your workspace are identified by their email in analytics. Furthermore, their emails show in analytics for every app in your workspace and not just apps they are explicitly invited to.

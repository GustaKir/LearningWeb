Title: Community Cloud User Authentication
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/user/st.user
Summary: This section explains how `st.experimental_user` works on Community Cloud. If not authenticated, it returns the user's email if they are logged in and part of the app's workspace; otherwise, it returns None. For authenticated apps, it behaves like locally running apps, with additional configuration required for identity providers and app secrets.

On Community Cloud, if your app is not configured for authentication, `st.experimental_user` will have a single attribute: `email`. If a user is logged in and a member of your app's workspace, this will return the user's email. For all other cases, it returns `None`.
On Community Cloud, if your app is configured for authentication (`[auth]` exists in your app's secrets), `st.experimental_user` will behave the same as a locally running app. Remember to update your identity provider's configuration and your app's secrets to allow your new domain. A list of [IP addresses](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/status#ip-addresses) used by Community Cloud is available if needed. An authentication-configured app counts as your one, allowed private app.

Get user info as a dictionary.
This method primarily exists for internal use and is not needed for most cases. `st.experimental_user` returns an object that inherits from `dict` by default.

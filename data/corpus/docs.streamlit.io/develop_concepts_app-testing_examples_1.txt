Title: App Testing Example - Testing a Login Page
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/app-testing/examples
Summary: This section outlines an example of testing a login page within a Streamlit app. It describes the absence of a `secrets.toml` file and the use of dummy secrets in tests. The section emphasizes the importance of security, highlighting the use of `hmac` for password comparison to prevent timing attacks. It encourages developers to consider the functionality that needs testing prior to writing code.

Let's consider a login page. In this example, `secrets.toml` is not present. We'll manually declare dummy secrets directly in the tests. To avoid [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack), the login script uses `hmac` to compare a user's password to the secret value as a security best practice.

Before diving into the app's code, let's think about what this page is supposed to do. Whether you use test-driven development or you write unit tests after your code, it's a good idea to think about the functionality that needs to be tested. The login page should behave as follows:
  * Before a user interacts with the app: 
    * Their status is "unverified."
    * A password prompt is displayed.
  * If a user types an incorrect password: 
    * Their status is "incorrect."
    * An error message is displayed.
    * The password attempt is cleared from the input.
  * If a user types a correct password: 
    * Their status is "verified."
    * A confirmation message is displayed.
    * A logout button is displayed (without a login prompt).
  * If a logged-in user clicks the **Log out** button: 
    * Their status is "unverified."
    * A password prompt is displayed.

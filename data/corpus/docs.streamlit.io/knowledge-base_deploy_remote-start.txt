Below are a few common errors that occur when users spin up their own solution to host a Streamlit app remotely.
To learn about a deceptively simple way to host Streamlit apps that avoids all the issues below, check out [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

When you enter the app's URL in a browser and all you see is a **blank page, a "Page not found" error, a "Connection refused" error** , or anything like that, first check that Streamlit is actually running on the remote server. On a Linux server you can SSH into it and then run:
`ps -Al | grep streamlit `
If you see Streamlit running, the most likely culprit is the Streamlit port not being exposed. The fix depends on your exact setup. Below are three example fixes:
  * **Try port 80:** Some hosts expose port 80 by default. To set Streamlit to use that port, start Streamlit with the `--server.port` option:
`streamlit run my_app.py --server.port=80 `
  * **AWS EC2 server** : First, click on your instance in the [AWS Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home). Then scroll down and click on _Security Groups_ ‚Üí _Inbound_ ‚Üí _Edit_. Next, add a _Custom TCP_ rule that allows the _Port Range_ `8501` with _Source_ `0.0.0.0/0`.
  * **Other types of server** : Check the firewall settings.

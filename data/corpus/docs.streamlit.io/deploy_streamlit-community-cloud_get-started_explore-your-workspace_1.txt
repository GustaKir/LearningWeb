If you just [created your account](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/create-your-account) and [connected your GitHub account](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account), congrats! You are now signed in and ready to go. If you are joining someone else's workspace you may already see some apps.

Each GitHub account and organization is associated with a workspace in Community Cloud. When you sign in to Community Cloud for the first time, you will land in your personal workspace associated with your GitHub user account. The upper-left corner of Community Cloud shows your current workspace.

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace#switching-workspaces)Switching workspaces
To switch between workspaces, click the workspace name in the upper-left corner and select a new workspace.
Other workspaces are available to you as follows:
  * When you have write permissions to a repository and the repository owner has joined Community Cloud, you can select the associated workspace. An owner can be a GitHub user or organization.
  * If someone has shared an app with you through Community Cloud, you will see the app's associated workspace. This is view-only access.

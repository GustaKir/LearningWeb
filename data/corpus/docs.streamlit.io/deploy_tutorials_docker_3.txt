Title: Building and Running a Docker Container for Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/tutorials/docker
Summary: This section covers the process of building a Docker image using the `docker build` command with a specified `Dockerfile`, tagging the image as 'streamlit'. It also explains how to run the Docker container, mapping port 8501 from the container to the server, allowing you to access the Streamlit application.

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/tutorials/docker#build-a-docker-image)Build a Docker image
The [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command builds an image from a `Dockerfile` . Run the following command from the `app/` directory on your server to build the image:
`docker build -t streamlit . `
The `-t` flag is used to tag the image. Here, we have tagged the image `streamlit`. If you run:
`docker images `
You should see a `streamlit` image under the REPOSITORY column. For example:
`REPOSITORY  TAG    IMAGE ID    CREATED       SIZE streamlit  latest  70b0759a094d  About a minute ago  1.02GB `
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/tutorials/docker#run-the-docker-container)Run the Docker container
Now that you have built the image, you can run the container by executing:
`docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit `
The `-p` flag publishes the container’s port 8501 to your server’s 8501 port.
If all went well, you should see an output similar to the following:
`docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.  URL: http://0.0.0.0:8501 `
To view your app, users can browse to `http://0.0.0.0:8501` or `http://localhost:8501`

#### Note
Based on your server's network configuration, you could map to port 80/443 so that users can view your app using the server IP or hostname. For example: `http://your-server-ip:80` or `http://your-hostname:443`.

So you've read all about Streamlit's [Basic concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) and gotten a taste of caching and Session State in [Advanced concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/advanced-concepts). But what about the bells and whistles? Here's a quick look at some extra features to take your app to the next level.

Streamlit supports Light and Dark themes out of the box. Streamlit will first check if the user viewing an app has a Light or Dark mode preference set by their operating system and browser. If so, then that preference will be used. Otherwise, the Light theme is applied by default.
You can also change the active theme from "⋮" → "Settings".

Want to add your own theme to an app? The "Settings" menu has a theme editor accessible by clicking on "Edit active theme". You can use this editor to try out different colors and see your app update live.

When you're happy with your work, themes can be saved by [setting config options](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration) in the `[theme]` config section. After you've defined a theme for your app, it will appear as "Custom Theme" in the theme selector and will be applied by default instead of the included Light and Dark themes.
More information about the options available when defining a theme can be found in the [theme option documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/theming).

#### Note
The theme editor menu is available only in local development. If you've deployed your app using Streamlit Community Cloud, the "Edit active theme" button will no longer be displayed in the "Settings" menu.

#### Tip
Another way to experiment with different theme colors is to turn on the "Run on save" option, edit your config.toml file, and watch as your app reruns with the new theme colors applied.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/additional-features#pages)Pages
As apps grow large, it becomes useful to organize them into multiple pages. This makes the app easier to manage as a developer and easier to navigate as a user. Streamlit provides a powerful way to create multipage apps using [`st.Page`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/navigation/st.page) and [`st.navigation`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/navigation/st.navigation). Just create your pages and connect them with navigation as follows:
  1. Create an entry point script that defines and connects your pages
  2. Create separate Python files for each page's content
  3. Use [`st.Page`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/navigation/st.page) to define your pages and [`st.navigation`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/navigation/st.navigation) to connect them

  3. In the confirmation dialog, click "**OK** " to push commits to "origin/main."

If you haven't learned Streamlit's basic concepts yet, this is a great time to go to [Fundamentals](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals). Use your codespace to walk through and try basic Streamlit commands. When finished, come back here to learn how to clean up your codespace.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/community-cloud#stop-or-delete-your-codespace)Stop or delete your codespace
When you stop interacting with your codespace, GitHub will generally stop your codespace for you. However, the surest way to avoid undesired use of your capacity is to stop or delete your codespace when you are done.
  1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (_more_horiz_) for your codespace.

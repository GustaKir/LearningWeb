Title: Streamlit Forms Limitations
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/forms
Summary: This section outlines key limitations when using forms in Streamlit, including restrictions on embedding forms, widget callbacks, and the interactivity of widgets within a form. Specifically, `st.button` and `st.download_button` cannot be included in a form, and `st.form` cannot be nested. Furthermore, only `st.form_submit_button` can have callback functions, which affects how interdependent widgets behave.

`.
  * `st.button` and `st.download_button` cannot be added to a form.
  * `st.form` cannot be embedded inside another `st.form`.
  * Callback functions can only be assigned to `st.form_submit_button` within a form; no other widgets in a form can have a callback.
  * Interdependent widgets within a form are unlikely to be particularly useful. If you pass `widget1`'s value into `widget2` when they are both inside a form, then `widget2` will only update when the form is submitted.

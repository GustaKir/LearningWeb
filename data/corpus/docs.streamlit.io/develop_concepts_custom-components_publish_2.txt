With your wheel created, the final step is to upload to PyPI. The instructions here highlight how to upload to [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/), so that you can learn the mechanics of the process without worrying about messing anything up. Uploading to PyPI follows the same basic procedure.
  1. Create an account on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) if you don't already have one
     * Visit <https://test.pypi.org/account/register/> and complete the steps
     * Visit <https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens> and create a new API token. Don’t limit the token scope to a particular project, since you are creating a new project. Copy your token before closing the page, as you won’t be able to retrieve it again.
  2. Upload your wheel to Test PyPI. `twine` will prompt you for a username and password. For the username, use **__token__**. For the password, use your token value from the previous step, including the `pypi-` prefix:
`python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* `
  3. Install your newly-uploaded package in a new Python project to make sure it works:
` python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps example-pkg-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE `


If all goes well, you're ready to upload your library to PyPI by following the instructions at <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#next-steps>.

To deploy the app to the Streamlit Cloud, follow these steps:
  1. Create a GitHub repository for the app. Your repository should contain two files:
`your-repository/ â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt `
  2. Go to [Streamlit Community Cloud](http://share.streamlit.io), click the `New app` button from your workspace, then specify the repository, branch, and main file path. Optionally, you can customize your app's URL by choosing a custom subdomain.
  3. Click the `Deploy!` button.


Your app will now be deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud and can be accessed from around the world! ðŸŒŽ

Congratulations on building an LLM-powered Streamlit app in 18 lines of code! ðŸ¥³ You can use this app to generate text from any prompt that you provide. The app is limited by the capabilities of the OpenAI LLM, but it can still be used to generate some creative and interesting text.
We hope you found this tutorial helpful! Check out [more examples](https://streamlit.io/generative-ai) to see the power of Streamlit and LLM. ðŸ’–
Happy Streamlit-ing! ðŸŽˆ

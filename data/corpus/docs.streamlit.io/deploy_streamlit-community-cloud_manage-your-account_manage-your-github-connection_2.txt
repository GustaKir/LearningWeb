If an organization owner has restricted Streamlit's access or restricted all OAuth applications, they may need to directly modify their permissions in GitHub. If an organization has restricted Streamlit's access, a red X (_close_) will appear next to the organization when you are prompted to authorize with your GitHub account.

Community Cloud identifies apps by their GitHub coordinates (owner, repository, branch, entrypoint file path). If you rename your account or repository from which you've deployed an app, you will lose access to administer the app. To learn more, see [Rename your app in GitHub](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/rename-your-app).

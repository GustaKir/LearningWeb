You see the following message after signing in to your Streamlit Community Cloud account:
![Huh. This is isn't supposed to happen message](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/knowledge-base/huh-this-isnt-supposed-to-happen.png)
This message usually indicates that our system has linked your GitHub username with an email address other than the email address you're currently logged in with.

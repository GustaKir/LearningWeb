Title: Handling Large Datasets in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/dataframes
Summary: Streamlit leverages optimizations for apps managing large datasets (over 150,000 rows) by disabling column sorting to enhance performance. Limitations include automatic conversion of column names to strings, non-configurable dataframe toolbars, and restricted editing capabilities for specific column types.
---

In addition to these factors, a slow network connection can also significantly slow down apps that handle large datasets.
When handling large datasets with more than 150,000 rows, Streamlit applies additional optimizations and disables column sorting. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed at once and improve the app's performance.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/dataframes#limitations)Limitations
  * Streamlit casts all column names to strings internally, so `st.data_editor` will return a DataFrame where all column names are strings.
  * The dataframe toolbar is not currently configurable.
  * While Streamlit's data editing capabilities offer a lot of functionality, editing is enabled for a limited set of column types ([TextColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.textcolumn), [NumberColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.numbercolumn), [LinkColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.linkcolumn), [CheckboxColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.checkboxcolumn), [SelectboxColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.selectboxcolumn), [DateColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datecolumn), [TimeColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.timecolumn), and [DatetimeColumn](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datetimecolumn)). We are actively working on supporting editing for other column types as well, such as images, lists, and charts.
  * Almost all editable datatypes are supported for index editing. However, `pandas.CategoricalIndex` and `pandas.MultiIndex` are not supported for editing.
  * Sorting is not supported for `st.data_editor` when `num_rows="dynamic"`.
  * Sorting is deactivated to optimize performance on large datasets with more than 150,000 rows.


We are continually working to improve Streamlit's handling of DataFrame and add functionality to data editing, so keep an eye out for updates.

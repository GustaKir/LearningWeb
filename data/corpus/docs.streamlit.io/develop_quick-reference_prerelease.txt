At Streamlit, we like to move quick while keeping things stable. In our latest effort to move even faster without sacrificing stability, we're offering our bold and fearless users two ways to try out Streamlit's bleeding-edge features:
  1. [Experimental features](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/prerelease#experimental-features)
  2. [Nightly releases](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/prerelease#nightly-releases)


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/prerelease#experimental-features)Experimental Features
Less stable Streamlit features have one naming convention: `st.experimental_`. This distinction is a prefix we attach to our command names to make sure their status is clear to everyone.
Here's a quick rundown of what you get from each naming convention:
  * **st** : this is where our core features like `st.write` and `st.dataframe` live. If we ever make backward-incompatible changes to these, they will take place gradually and with months of announcements and warnings.
  * **experimental** : this is where we'll put all new features that may or may not ever make it into Streamlit core. This gives you a chance to try the next big thing we're cooking up weeks or months before we're ready to stabilize its API. We don't know whether these features have a future, but we want you to have access to everything we're trying, and work with us to figure them out.

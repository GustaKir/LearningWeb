Title: st.write and Magic Commands in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/write-magic
Summary: Streamlit offers two primary methods for displaying information in applications: `st.write`, which outputs various data types including strings and figures, and magic commands that automatically render any standalone variable or literal on its own line. Additionally, `st.write_stream` provides a typewriter effect for streaming data displays.

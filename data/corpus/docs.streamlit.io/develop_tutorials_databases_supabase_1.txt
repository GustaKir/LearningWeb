This guide explains how to securely access a Supabase instance from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses [st.connection](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connection), [Streamlit Supabase Connector](https://github.com/SiddhantSadangi/st_supabase_connection/tree/main) (a community-built connection developed by [@SiddhantSadangi](https://github.com/SiddhantSadangi)) and Streamlit's [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/secrets-management). Supabase is the open source Firebase alternative and is based on PostgreSQL.

#### Note
Community-built connections, such as the [Streamlit Supabase Connector](https://github.com/SiddhantSadangi/st_supabase_connection/tree/main), extend and build on the `st.connection` interface and make it easier than ever to build Streamlit apps with a wide variety of data sources. These type of connections work exactly the same as [the ones built into Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections) and have access to all the same capabilities.

Authorize Supabase
Once you're signed in, you can create a project.

#### Important
Make sure to note down your Project API Key and Project URL highlighted in the above screenshot. ☝️
You will need these to connect to your Supabase instance from Streamlit.

Now that you have a project, you can create a database and populate it with some sample data. To do so, click on the **SQL editor** button on the same project page, followed by the **New query** button in the SQL editor.
![](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/supabase-6.png)
Open the SQL editor
![](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/supabase-7.png)
Create a new query
In the SQL editor, enter the following queries to create a database and a table with some example values:
`CREATE TABLE mytable (   name      varchar(80),   pet       varchar(80) ); INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird'); `
Click **Run** to execute the queries. To verify that the queries were executed successfully, click on the **Table Editor** button on the left menu, followed by your newly created table `mytable`.
![](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/supabase-8.png)
Write and run your queries
![](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/supabase-9.png)
View your table in the Table Editor
With your Supabase database created, you can now connect to it from Streamlit!

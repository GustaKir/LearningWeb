**Notable Changes**
  * 🤖 [`st.exception`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/status/st.exception) includes links to open Google or ChatGPT with the contents of the exception. This includes uncaught exceptions displayed in the app.
  * 🗺️ You can access the user's locale through [`st.context`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.context#contextlocale) ([#10563](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/10563)).

URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app
Summary: This section discusses the methods for embedding Streamlit apps, highlighting the differences between iframe and oEmbed. It emphasizes that iframing allows for customizable embedding options via the `?embed_options` query parameter, providing control over app behaviors such as toolbar visibility and theme settings.

The only noteworthy differences between the methods is that iframing allows you to customize the app's embedding behavior (e.g. showing the toolbar, opening the app in dark theme, etc) using the various `?embed_options` described in the next section.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app#embed-options)Embed options
When [Embedding with iframes](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app#embedding-with-iframes), Streamlit allows you to specify one or more instances of the `?embed_options` query parameter for granular control over the embedding behavior.
Both `?embed` and `?embed_options` are invisible to [`st.query_params`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.query_params) and its precursors, [`st.experimental_get_query_params`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.experimental_get_query_params) and [`st.experimental_set_query_params`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.experimental_set_query_params). You can't get or set their values.
The supported values for `?embed_options` are listed below:
  1. Show the toolbar at the top right of the app which includes the app menu (_more_vert_), running man, and link to GitHub.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=show_toolbar `
  2. Show padding at the top and bottom of the app.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=show_padding `
  3. Show the footer reading "Made with Streamlit." (This doesn't apply to Streamlit versions 1.29.0 and later since the footer was removed from the library.)
`/?embed=true&embed_options=show_footer `
  4. Show the colored line at the top of the app.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=show_colored_line `
  5. Hide the "skeleton" that appears while an app is loading.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=hide_loading_screen `
  6. Disable scrolling for the main body of the app. (The sidebar will still be scrollable.)
`/?embed=true&embed_options=disable_scrolling `
  7. Open the app with light theme.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=light_theme `
  8. Open the app with dark theme.
`/?embed=true&embed_options=dark_theme `


You can also combine the params:
`/?embed=true&embed_options=show_toolbar&embed_options=show_padding&embed_options=show_footer&embed_options=show_colored_line&embed_options=disable_scrolling `

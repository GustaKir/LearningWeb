If you have created an account but not yet connected GitHub, see [Connect your GitHub account](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account).
If you have already connected your GitHub account but still need to allow Streamlit Community Cloud to access private repositories, see [Optional: Add access to private repositories](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#optional-add-access-to-private-repositories).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/manage-your-github-connection#add-access-to-an-organization)Add access to an organization
If you are in an organization, you can grant or request access to that organization when you connect your GitHub account. For more information, see [Organization access](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account#organization-access).
If your GitHub account is already connected, you can remove permissions in your GitHub settings and force Streamlit to reprompt for GitHub authorization the next time you sign in to Community Cloud.

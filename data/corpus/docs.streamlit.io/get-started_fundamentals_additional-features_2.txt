Title: Creating a Multi-Page Streamlit App
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/additional-features
Summary: This section provides an example of a three-page Streamlit app, detailing the necessary code to set up different pages with icons and a navigation menu. The implementation includes a main page and two additional pages, each with markdown content. It concludes by instructing users to run the application with a specific command to view the multipage functionality.
---

Here's an example of a three-page app:
`streamlit_app.py`
`import streamlit as st # Define the pages main_page = st.Page("main_page.py", title="Main Page", icon="🎈") page_2 = st.Page("page_2.py", title="Page 2", icon="❄️") page_3 = st.Page("page_3.py", title="Page 3", icon="🎉") # Set up navigation pg = st.navigation([main_page, page_2, page_3]) # Run the selected page pg.run() `
`main_page.py`
`import streamlit as st # Main page content st.markdown("# Main page 🎈") st.sidebar.markdown("# Main page 🎈") `
`page_2.py`
`import streamlit as st st.markdown("# Page 2 ❄️") st.sidebar.markdown("# Page 2 ❄️") `
`page_3.py`
`import streamlit as st st.markdown("# Page 3 🎉") st.sidebar.markdown("# Page 3 🎉") `
Now run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` and view your shiny new multipage app! The navigation menu will automatically appear, allowing users to switch between pages.

Our documentation on [Multipage apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps) teaches you how to add pages to your app, including how to define pages, structure and run multipage apps, and navigate between pages. Once you understand the basics, [create your first multipage app](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app)!

If you can't find the right component within the Streamlit library, try out custom components to extend Streamlit's built-in functionality. Explore and browse through popular, community-created components in the [Components gallery](https://streamlit.io/components). If you dabble in frontend development, you can build your own custom component with Streamlit's [components API](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/custom-components/intro).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/additional-features#static-file-serving)Static file serving
As you learned in Streamlit fundamentals, Streamlit runs a server that clients connect to. That means viewers of your app don't have direct access to the files which are local to your app. Most of the time, this doesn't matter because Streamlt commands handle that for you. When you use `st.image(<path-to-image>)` your Streamlit server will access the file and handle the necessary hosting so your app viewers can see it. However, if you want a direct URL to an image or file you'll need to host it. This requires setting the correct configuration and placing your hosted files in a directory named `static`. For example, your project could look like:
`your-project/ ├── static/ │  └── my_hosted-image.png └── streamlit_app.py `

Good development hygiene includes testing your code. Automated testing allows you to write higher quality code, faster! Streamlit has a built-in testing framework that let's you build tests easily. Use your favorite testing framework to run your tests. We like [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/). When you test a Streamlit app, you simulate running the app, declare user input, and inspect the results. You can use GitHub workflows to automate your tests and get instant alerts about breaking changes. Learn more in our guide to [App testing](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/app-testing).

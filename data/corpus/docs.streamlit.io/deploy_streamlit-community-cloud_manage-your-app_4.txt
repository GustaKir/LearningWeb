Title: Managing Resource Limits in Streamlit Community Cloud
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app
Summary: When an app exceeds its resource limits, users will encounter an error message: 'ðŸ˜¦ Oh no.' To address this, check the Cloud logs for errors. Developers can access the 'Manage app' feature to reboot and clear memory if signed in with a developer account.
---

If your app exceeds its resource limits, developers and viewers alike will see "ðŸ˜¦ Oh no."

If see "ðŸ˜¦ Oh no." when viewing your app, first check your Cloud logs for any specific errors. If there are no errors in your Cloud logs you are likely dealing with a resource issue.

If you are signed in to a developer account for an app over its limits, you can access "**Manage app** " from the lower-right corner of the app to reboot it and clear its memory. "**Manage app** " will be red and have a warning icon (_error_).

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-hibernation)App hibernation
All apps without traffic for 12 hours go to sleep. Community Cloud hibernates apps to conserve resources and allow the best communal use of the platform. To keep your app awake, simply visit your app.
When someone visits a sleeping app, they will see the sleeping page:
![App state: Zzzz. This app has gone to sleep due to inactivity.](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/streamlit-community-cloud/app-state-zzzz.png)
To wake the app up, click "**Yes, get this app back up!** " This can be done by  _anyone_ who has access to view the app, not just the app developer!
You can see which of your apps are asleep from your workspace. Sleeping apps have a moon icon (_bedtime_) to the right.

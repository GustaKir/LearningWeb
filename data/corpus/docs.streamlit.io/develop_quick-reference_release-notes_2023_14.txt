URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2023
Summary: This section outlines several improvements in the 2023 Streamlit release, including renaming endpoints for consistency, enhanced caching performance for simultaneous sessions, management of deprecation warnings, and refactoring of the `st.dataframe` function for better dataframe handling.
---

**Other Changes**
  * 🏁 All Streamlit endpoints (including `/healthz`) have been renamed to have a consistent pattern and avoid any clashes with reserved endpoints of GCP (notably Cloud Run and App Engine) ([#5534](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5534)).
  * ⚡ Improved caching performance when multiple sessions access an uncomputed cached value simultaneously ([#6017](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6017)).
  * 🚧 Streamlit only displays deprecation warnings in the browser when the `client.showErrorDetails` config option is set to `True`. Deprecation warnings always get logged to the console, regardless of whether they're displayed in-browser ([#5945](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5945)).
  * 🏓 Refactored the `st.dataframe` internals to improve dataframe handling and conversion, such as detecting more types, converting key-value dicts to dataframes, and more ([#6026](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6026), [#6023](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6023)).
  * 💽 The behavior of widget labels when they are passed unsupported Markdown elements is documented ([#5978](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5978)).
  * 📊 Bug fix: Plotly improvements — upgraded multiple frontend dependencies, including Plotly, to the latest version to properly redraw cached charts, make Plotly mapbox animations work, and allow users to update the figure layout when using the Streamlit theme ([#5885](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5885), [#5967](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5967), [#6055](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6055)).
  * 📶 Bug fix: allow browser tabs that transiently disconnect (due to a network blip, load balancer timeout, etc.) to avoid losing all of their state ([#5856](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5856)).
  * 📱 Bug fix: the keyboard is hidden on mobile when `st.selectbox` and `st.multiselect` have less than 10 options ([#5979](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5979)).
  * 🐝 Bug fix: design tweaks to `st.metric`, `st.multiselect`, `st.tabs` , and menu items to prevent label overflow and scrolling issues, especially with small viewport sizes ([#5933](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5933), [#6034](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6034)).
  * 🐞 Bug fix: switched to a functioning Twemoji URL from which page favicons are loaded in `st.set_page_config` ([#5943](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5943)).
  * ✍️ More type hints ([#5986](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5986)). Thanks, [harahu](https://github.com/harahu)!

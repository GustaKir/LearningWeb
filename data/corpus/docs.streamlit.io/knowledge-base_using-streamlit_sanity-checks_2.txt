Title: Sanity Checks for Streamlit Issues
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks
Summary: This section outlines important checks to troubleshoot issues after upgrading to Streamlit, including how to downgrade versions and ensuring Python is added to the Windows PATH to avoid errors.

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-5-is-this-a-streamlit-regression)Check #5: Is this a Streamlit regression?
If you've upgraded to the latest version of Streamlit and things aren't working, you can downgrade at any time using this command:
`pip install --upgrade streamlit==1.0.0 `
...where `1.0.0` is the version you'd like to downgrade to. See [Release notes](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes) for a complete list of Streamlit versions.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-6-windows-is-python-added-to-your-path)Check #6 [Windows]: Is Python added to your PATH?
When installed by downloading from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), Python is not automatically added to the [Windows system PATH](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access). Because of this, you may get error messages like the following:
Command Prompt:
`C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello 'streamlit' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. `
PowerShell:
`PS C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello streamlit : The term 'streamlit' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. At line:1 char:1 + streamlit hello + ~~~~~~~~~   + CategoryInfo     : ObjectNotFound: (streamlit:String) [], CommandNotFoundException   + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException `
To resolve this issue, add [Python to the Windows system PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
After adding Python to your Windows PATH, you should then be able to follow the instructions in our [Get Started](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) section.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-7-windows-do-you-need-build-tools-for-visual-studio-installed)Check #7 [Windows]: Do you need Build Tools for Visual Studio installed?
Streamlit includes [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) as an install dependency. Occasionally, when trying to install Streamlit from PyPI, you may see errors such as the following:
`Using cached pyarrow-1.0.1.tar.gz (1.3 MB)  Installing build dependencies ... error  ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:   command: 'c:\users\streamlit\appdata\local\programs\python\python38-32\python.exe' 'c:\users\streamlit\appdata\local\programs\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages\pip' install --ignore-installed --no-user --prefix 'C:\Users\streamlit\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-build-env-s7owjrle\overlay' --no-warn-script-location --no-binary :none: --only-binary :none: -i https://pypi.org/simple -- 'cython >= 0.29' 'numpy==1.14.5; python_version<'"'"'3.9'"'"'' 'numpy==1.16.0; python_version>='"'"'3.9'"'"'' setuptools setuptools_scm wheel     cwd: None  Complete output (319 lines):    Running setup.py install for numpy: finished with status 'error'    ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:    # <truncated for brevity> #    building library "npymath" sources    No module named 'numpy.distutils._msvccompiler' in numpy.distutils; trying from distutils    error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required.

This error indicates that Python is trying to compile certain libraries during install, but it cannot find the proper compilers on your system, as reflected by the line `error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Build Tools for Visual Studio"`.
Installing [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) should resolve this issue.

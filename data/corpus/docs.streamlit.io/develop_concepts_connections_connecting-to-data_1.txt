Title: Connecting to Data in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/connecting-to-data
Summary: This section outlines how to connect to various data sources in Streamlit applications, including basic usage, setting up a local SQLite database with SQLAlchemy, and managing database connections through the Streamlit 'secrets.toml' file.

Most Streamlit apps need some kind of data or API access to be useful - either retrieving data to view or saving the results of some user action. This data or API is often part of some remote service, database, or other data source.
**Anything you can do with Python, including data connections, will generally work in Streamlit**. Streamlit's [tutorials](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases) are a great starting place for many data sources. However:
  * Connecting to data in a Python application is often tedious and annoying.
  * There are specific considerations for connecting to data from streamlit apps, such as caching and secrets management.

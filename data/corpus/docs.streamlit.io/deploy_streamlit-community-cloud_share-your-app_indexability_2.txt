If you don't want your app to be indexed by search engines, you can make it private. Read [Share your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app) to learn more about making your app private. Note: each workspace can only have one private app. If you want to make your app private, you must first delete any other private app in your workspace or make it public.
That said, Community Cloud is an open and free platform for the community to deploy, discover, and share Streamlit apps and code with each other. As such, we encourage you to make your app public so that it can be indexed by search engines and discovered by other Streamlit users and community members.

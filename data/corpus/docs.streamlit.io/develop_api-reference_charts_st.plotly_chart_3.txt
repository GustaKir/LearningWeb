Title: Streamlit Plotly Chart Integration
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart
Summary: This section details the integration of Plotly charts within Streamlit, highlighting example data for selection states and the default theming which aligns with Streamlit's design. Users can choose to use the Streamlit theme or revert to Plotly's native theme from version 1.16.0.

This is an example of the selection state when selecting a single point:
```
{
 "points": [
  {
   "curve_number": 2,
   "point_number": 9,
   "point_index": 9,
   "x": 3.6,
   "y": 7.2,
   "customdata": [
    2.5
   ],
   "marker_size": 6.1,
   "legendgroup": "virginica"
  }
 ],
 "point_indices": [
  9
 ],
 "box": [],
 "lasso": []
}

Plotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.
The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme="streamlit"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.
Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:
`import plotly.express as px import streamlit as st df = px.data.gapminder() fig = px.scatter(   df.query("year==2007"),   x="gdpPercap",   y="lifeExp",   size="pop",   color="continent",   hover_name="country",   log_x=True,   size_max=60, ) tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"]) with tab1: # Use the Streamlit theme. # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.   st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True) with tab2: # Use the native Plotly theme.   st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True) `
Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!
Here's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:
`import plotly.express as px import streamlit as st st.subheader("Define a custom colorscale") df = px.data.iris() fig = px.scatter(   df,   x="sepal_width",   y="sepal_length",   color="sepal_length",   color_continuous_scale="reds", ) tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"]) with tab1:   st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True) with tab2:   st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True) `
Notice how the custom color scale is still reflected in the chart, even when the Streamlit theme is enabled ðŸ‘‡

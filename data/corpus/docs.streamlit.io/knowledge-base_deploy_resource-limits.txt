# [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/deploy/resource-limits#argh-this-app-has-gone-over-its-resource-limits)Argh. This app has gone over its resource limits
Sorry! It means you've hit the [resource limits](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-resources-and-limits) of your [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) account.
There are a few things you can change in your app to make it less resource-hungry:
  * Reboot your app (temporary fix)
  * Use `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource` to load models or data only once
  * Restrict the cache size with `ttl` or `max_entries`
  * Move big datasets to a database
  * Profile your app's memory usage


Check out our [blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/common-app-problems-resource-limits/) on ["Common app problems: Resource limits"](https://blog.streamlit.io/common-app-problems-resource-limits/) for more in-depth tips prevent your app from hitting the [resource limits](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-resources-and-limits) of the Streamlit Community Cloud.

Title: Adding Subtitles to Videos in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/media/st.video
Summary: This section explains how to include subtitles in videos using Streamlit. Subtitles will be turned on by default, but viewers can disable them through the video controls. A sample VTT file is provided, along with code examples on how to implement subtitles for a video using the `st.video` function.

When you include subtitles, they will be turned on by default. A viewer can turn off the subtitles (or captions) from the browser's default video control menu, usually located in the lower-right corner of the video.
Here is a simple VTT file (`subtitles.vtt`):
```
WEBVTT
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:02.000
Look!
0:00:03.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Look at the pretty stars!
```

Copy
If the above VTT file lives in the same directory as your app, you can add subtitles like so:
```
import streamlit as st
VIDEO_URL = "https://example.com/not-youtube.mp4"
st.video(VIDEO_URL, subtitles="subtitles.vtt")
```

See additional examples of supported subtitle input types in our [video subtitles feature demo](https://doc-video-subtitle-inputs.streamlit.app/).
Note
Some videos may not display if they are encoded using MP4V (which is an export option in OpenCV), as this codec is not widely supported by browsers. Converting your video to H.264 will allow the video to be displayed in Streamlit.

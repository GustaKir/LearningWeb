Title: Magic Commands in Streamlit
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/write-magic/magic
Summary: Magic commands in Streamlit enable users to display content such as markdown, data, and charts seamlessly, without needing explicit commands. By placing items on their own lines of code, users can easily render components like titles, dataframes, and charts in their applications.

Magic commands are a feature in Streamlit that allows you to write almost anything (markdown, data, charts) without having to type an explicit command at all. Just put the thing you want to show on its own line of code, and it will appear in your app. Here's an example:
`# Draw a title and some text to the app: ''' # This is the document title This is some _markdown_. ''' import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1,2,3]}) df # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the dataframe x = 10 'x', x # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the string 'x' and then the value of x # Also works with most supported chart types import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.hist(arr, bins=20) fig # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw a Matplotlib chart `

Any time Streamlit sees either a variable or literal value on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using [`st.write`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write) (which you'll learn about later).
Also, magic is smart enough to ignore docstrings. That is, it ignores the strings at the top of files and functions.
If you prefer to call Streamlit commands more explicitly, you can always turn magic off in your `~/.streamlit/config.toml` with the following setting:
`[runner] magicEnabled = false `

#### Important
Right now, Magic only works in the main Python app file, not in imported files. See GitHub issue #288 for a discussion of the issues.

Title: Sanity Checks for Streamlit Apps
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks
Summary: This document provides troubleshooting steps for problems encountered while running Streamlit applications. It emphasizes checking for a supported version of Python, noting compatibility with the last three minor versions of Python 3 and current support for versions 3.9 to 3.13.

If you're having problems running your Streamlit app, here are a few things to try out.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-0-are-you-using-a-streamlit-supported-version-of-python)Check #0: Are you using a Streamlit-supported version of Python?
Streamlit will maintain backwards-compatibility with earlier Python versions as practical, guaranteeing compatibility with _at least_ the last three minor versions of Python 3.
As new versions of Python are released, we will try to be compatible with the new version as soon as possible, though frequently we are at the mercy of other Python packages to support these new versions as well.
Streamlit currently supports versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 of Python.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-1-is-streamlit-running)Check #1: Is Streamlit running?
On a Mac or Linux machine, type this on the terminal:
`ps -Al | grep streamlit `
If you don't see `streamlit run` in the output (or `streamlit hello`, if that's the command you ran) then the Streamlit server is not running. So re-run your command and see if the bug goes away.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-2-is-this-an-already-fixed-streamlit-bug)Check #2: Is this an already-fixed Streamlit bug?
We try to fix bugs quickly, so many times a problem will go away when you upgrade Streamlit. So the first thing to try when having an issue is upgrading to the latest version of Streamlit:
`pip install --upgrade streamlit streamlit version `
...and then verify that the version number printed corresponds to the version number displayed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/).
**Try reproducing the issue now.** If not fixed, keep reading on.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-3-are-you-running-the-correct-streamlit-binary)Check #3: Are you running the correct Streamlit binary?
Let's check whether your Python environment is set up correctly. Edit the Streamlit script where you're experiencing your issue, **comment everything out, and add these lines instead:**
`import streamlit as st st.write(st.__version__) `
...then call `streamlit run` on your script and make sure it says the same version as above. If not the same version, check out [these instructions](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation) for some sure-fire ways to set up your environment.
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks#check-4-is-your-browser-caching-your-app-too-aggressively)Check #4: Is your browser caching your app too aggressively?
There are two easy ways to check this:
  1. Load your app in a browser then press `Ctrl-Shift-R` or `âŒ˜-Shift-R` to do a hard refresh (Chrome/Firefox).
  2. As a test, run Streamlit on another port. This way the browser starts the page with a brand new cache. For that, pass the `--server.port` argument to Streamlit on the command line:
`streamlit run my_app.py --server.port=9876 `

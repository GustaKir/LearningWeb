  1. Answer a few questions to let us know more about yourself, or skip them.
  2. A message will display: "You're now signed up!" Go to your email, and click on the activation link. (Within your link, note the subdomain. This is your Snowflake account identifier. `https://<account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com`)
  3. Set your username and password. This will be an admin user account within your Snowflake account. Your Snowflake account can have multiple users within it.
  4. If you are not signed in after setting your password, follow the instructions to enter your Snowflake account identifier, and then enter your username and password. If you've accidentally closed your browser, you can sign in at [app.snowflake.com](https://app.snowflake.com/).


Congratulations! You have a trial Snowflake account.
The displayed interface is called Snowsight. Snowsight provides a web-based, graphical user interface for your Snowflake account. The default page is "**Home** ," which provides popular quick actions to get started. You can access your "**Projects** " in the left navigation or at the bottom of your "**Home** " page. "**Projects** " include worksheets, notebooks, Streamlit apps, and dashboards. Check out the Snowflake docs for a [quick tour](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-quick-tour).)

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake#optional-create-a-warehouse)Optional: Create a warehouse
Warehouses provide compute resources for tasks and apps in your Snowflake account. Your trial account already has an XS warehouse which you can use. This is named "COMPUTE_WH." However, if you want to use more compute resources, you can create another warehouse.
  1. In the lower-left corner under your name, confirm that your current role is "ACCOUNTADMIN." If it isn't, click your name, hover over "**Switch Role** ," and select "**ACCOUNTADMIN**."
  2. In the left navigation, select "**Admin** " → "**Warehouses**."
  3. In the upper-right corner, click the blue "_add_ **Warehouse** " button.
  4. Enter "STREAMLIT_WH" for the name and select a type and size. The default type and size are "Standard" and "X-Small," respectively. Click "**Create Warehouse**."


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake#create-a-database)Create a database
Databases provide storage for data and apps in your Snowflake account. Your trial account comes with a shared database of sample data, but you must create a new database in your account to store your app files.
  1. In the left navigation, select "**Data** " → "**Databases**."
  2. In the upper-right corner, click the blue "_add_ **Database** " button.
  3. Enter "STREAMLIT_DB" for the name, and click "**Create**."


Yay! You now have a new database to hold all your Streamlit apps.

The databases in the above screenshot are as follows:
  * "SNOWFLAKE:" A built-in database that stores meta data for your account.
  * "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA:" A shared database with sample data.
  * "STREAMLIT_DB:" Your new database where you'll put your Streamlit files.

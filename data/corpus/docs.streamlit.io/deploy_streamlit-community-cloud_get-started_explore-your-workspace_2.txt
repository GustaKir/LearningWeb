Title: Exploring Your Workspace in Streamlit Community Cloud
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace
Summary: This section explains how to invite other developers to your Streamlit workspace by granting them write access to your GitHub repository. Once they sign in to share.streamlit.io, they can collaborate on deployments and management of apps. Developer permissions are inherited from GitHub, allowing shared access within the workspace.

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace#invite-other-developers-to-your-workspace)Invite other developers to your workspace
Inviting other developers is simple: Just give them write access to your GitHub repository so that you can code together. When they sign in to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), they'll have access to your workspace.
Streamlit Community Cloud inherits developer permissions from GitHub. When others sign in to Community Cloud, they will automatically see the workspaces they share with you. From there you can all deploy, manage, and share apps together.

#### Note
When a user is added to a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before they can deploy or manage the app on Community Cloud. If a user is removed from a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before their permission to manage the app from that repository is revoked.
And remember, whenever anyone on the team updates the code on GitHub, the app will automatically update for you!
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace#my-apps)My apps
The "**My apps** " section of your workspace is your base of operations to deploy and manage your apps. When you deploy an app, it is added to this section of your workspace.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/explore-your-workspace#deploying-apps)Deploying apps
If you already have an app saved to a GitHub repo, you can deploy it directly. Otherwise, Community Cloud provides templates you can use. When you deploy from a template, Community Cloud will fork a project into your GitHub account and deploy from the new fork. This is a convenient way to get started if you haven't already created a Streamlit app.
To get started, just click "**Create app** " in the upper-right corner. To learn more, see [Deploy your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app) and [Deploy from a template](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-from-a-template).

The "**My profile** " section of your workspace lets you customize a personal portfolio of Streamlit apps to share with the world. Curate and feature your Streamlit apps to show off your work.

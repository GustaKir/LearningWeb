Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star (_star_) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/authentication
Summary: This section details how to configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) parameters for Streamlit authentication. It explains the default settings for scope and prompt, how to customize these parameters using a dictionary of settings, and provides an example configuration for using Auth0 to enforce login prompts.

ed to declare additional keywords. For a complete list of OIDC parameters, see [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) and your provider's documentation. By default, Streamlit sets `scope="openid profile email"` and `prompt="select_account"`. You can change these and other OIDC parameters by passing a dictionary of settings to `client_kwargs`. `state` and `nonce`, which are used for security, are handled automatically and don't need to be specified.
For example,if you are using Auth0 and need to force users to log in every time, use `prompt="login"` as described in Auth0's [Customize Signup and Login Prompts](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/login-pages/universal-login/customize-signup-and-login-prompts). Your configuration will look like this:
`[auth] redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8501/oauth2callback" cookie_secret = "xxx" [auth.auth0] client_id = "xxx" client_secret = "xxx" server_metadata_url = (   "https://{account}.{region}.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration" ) client_kwargs = { "prompt" = "login" } `

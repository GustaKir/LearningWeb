Title: Streamlit's Native App Testing Framework
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/app-testing
Summary: Streamlit provides a native app testing framework that allows developers to create and run automated tests with ease. Using the AppTest class, developers can simulate a running app and manipulate its contents through an API, offering a simpler alternative to browser automation tools like Selenium. The framework can be integrated with tools like pytest for executing tests, ensuring consistent app functionality throughout development.

Streamlit app testing enables developers to build and run automated tests. Bring your favorite test automation software and enjoy simple syntax to simulate user input and inspect rendered output.
The provided class, AppTest, simulates a running app and provides methods to set up, manipulate, and inspect the app contents via API instead of a browser UI. AppTest provides similar functionality to browser automation tools like Selenium or Playwright, but with less overhead to write and execute tests. Use our testing framework with a tool like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to execute or automate your tests. A typical pattern is to build a suite of tests for an app to ensure consistent functionality as the app evolves. The tests run locally and/or in a CI environment like GitHub Actions.

After making edits to your app, you can choose to commit your edits to your repository to update your deployed app instantly.

  5. To push your commit to GitHub, in the source control sidebar on the left, click "**_cached_ 1 _arrow_upward_**."
  6. To push commits to "origin/main," in the confirmation dialog, click "**OK**."
Your changes are now saved to your GitHub repository. Community Cloud will immediately reflect the changes in your deployed app.

When you stop interacting with your codespace, GitHub will generally stop your codespace for you. However, the surest way to avoid undesired use of your capacity is to stop or delete your codespace when you are done.
  1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (_more_horiz_) for your codespace.

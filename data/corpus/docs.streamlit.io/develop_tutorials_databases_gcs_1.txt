This guide explains how to securely access files on Google Cloud Storage from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses [Streamlit FilesConnection](https://github.com/streamlit/files-connection), the [gcsfs](https://github.com/fsspec/gcsfs) library and Streamlit's [Secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/secrets-management).

#### Note
If you already have a bucket that you want to use, feel free to [skip to the next step](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/gcs#enable-the-google-cloud-storage-api).
First, [sign up for Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or log in. Go to the [Google Cloud Storage console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/) and create a new bucket.

Navigate to the upload section of your new bucket:
![GCS screenshot 3](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/gcs-3.png)![GCS screenshot 4](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/databases/gcs-4.png)
And upload the following CSV file, which contains some example data:

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/gcs#enable-the-google-cloud-storage-api)Enable the Google Cloud Storage API
The Google Cloud Storage API is [enabled by default](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enabled-service#default) when you create a project through the Google Cloud Console or CLI. Feel free to [skip to the next step](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/gcs#create-a-service-account-and-key-file).
If you do need to enable the API for programmatic access in your project, head over to the [APIs & Services dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) (select or create a project if asked). Search for the Cloud Storage API and enable it. The screenshot below has a blue "Manage" button and indicates the "API is enabled" which means no further action needs to be taken. This is very likely what you have since the API is enabled by default. However, if that is not what you see and you have an "Enable" button, you'll need to enable the API:

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/gcs#create-a-service-account-and-key-file)Create a service account and key file
To use the Google Cloud Storage API from Streamlit, you need a Google Cloud Platform service account (a special type for programmatic data access). Go to the Service Accounts page and create an account with **Viewer** permission.

#### Note
If the button **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT** is gray, you don't have the correct permissions. Ask the admin of your Google Cloud project for help.
After clicking **DONE** , you should be back on the service accounts overview. Create a JSON key file for the new account and download it:

  1. Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.
It can take several minutes to fully initialize your codespace. After you see the Visual Studio Code editor in your codespace, it can take several minutes to install Python and start the Streamlit server. When complete, you will see a split screen view with a code editor on the left and a running app on the right. The code editor opens two tabs by default: the repository's readme file and the app's entrypoint file.

  2. Go to the app's entrypoint file (`streamlit_app.py`) in the left pane, and change line 3 by adding "Streamlit" inside `st.title`.
`-st.title("ðŸŽˆ My new app") +st.title("ðŸŽˆ My new Streamlit app") `
Files are automatically saved in your codespace with each edit.
  3. A moment after typing a change, your app on the right side will display a rerun prompt. Click "**Always rerun**."

If the rerun prompt disappears before you click it, you can hover over the overflow menu icon (_more_vert_) to bring it back.
  4. Optional: Continue to make edits and observe the changes within seconds.

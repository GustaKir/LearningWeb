Title: Naming Conventions and Tips for Streamlit Multi-Page Apps
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/pages-directory
Summary: This section provides examples of how filenames correspond to rendered labels in the sidebar of a Streamlit multi-page app. It includes tips on using emojis in filenames for more engaging page titles while also recommending the inclusion of a numbered prefix for better terminal autocompletion. Additionally, it notes the feature that allows pages to support run-on-save, causing a rerun for users viewing a page when updates are made.
---

This table shows examples of filenames and their corresponding labels, sorted by the order in which they appear in the sidebar.
**Examples** :
**Filename**| **Rendered label**  
---|---  
`1 - first page.py`|  first page  
`12 monkeys.py`| monkeys  
`123.py`| 123  
`123_hello_dear_world.py`| hello dear world  
`_12 monkeys.py`| 12 monkeys

#### Tip
Emojis can be used to make your page names more fun! For example, a file named `üè†_Home.py` will create a page titled "üè† Home" in the sidebar. When adding emojis to filenames, it‚Äôs best practice to include a numbered prefix to make autocompletion in your terminal easier. Terminal-autocomplete can get confused by unicode (which is how emojis are represented).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/pages-directory#notes-and-limitations)Notes and limitations
  * Pages support run-on-save.
    * When you update a page while your app is running, this causes a rerun for users currently viewing that exact page.
    * When you update a page while your app is running, the app will not automatically rerun for users currently viewing a different page.
  * While your app is running, adding or deleting a page updates the sidebar navigation immediately.
  * [`st.set_page_config`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config) works at the page level.
    * When you set `title` or `favicon` using `st.set_page_config`, this applies to the current page only.
    * When you set `layout` using `st.set_page_config`, the setting will remain for the session until changed by another call to `st.set_page_config`. If you use `st.set_page_config` to set `layout`, it's recommended to call it on _all_ pages.
  * Pages share the same Python modules globally:
`# page1.py import foo foo.hello = 123 # page2.py import foo st.write(foo.hello) # If page1 already executed, this writes 123 `
  * Pages share the same [st.session_state](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state):
`# page1.py import streamlit as st if "shared" not in st.session_state:   st.session_state["shared"] = True # page2.py import streamlit as st st.write(st.session_state["shared"]) # If page1 already executed, this writes True `


You now have a solid understanding of multipage apps. You've learned how to structure apps, define pages, and navigate between pages in the user interface. It's time to [create your first multipage app](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app)! ü•≥

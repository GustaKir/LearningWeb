## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0570)Version 0.57.0
_Release date: March 26, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * ‚è≤Ô∏è Ability to set expiration options for `@st.cache`'ed functions by setting the `max_entries` and `ttl` arguments. See [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.cache).
  * üÜô Improved the machinery behind `st.file_uploader`, so it's much more performant now! Also increased the default upload limit to 200MB (configurable via `server.max_upload_size`).
  * üîí The `server.address` config option now _binds_ the server to that address for added security.
  * üìÑ Even more details added to error messages for `@st.cache` for easier debugging.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0560)Version 0.56.0
_Release date: February 15, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * üìÑ Improved error messages for st.cache. The errors now also point to the new caching docs we just released. Read more [here](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/help-us-stress-test-streamlit-s-latest-caching-update/1944)!


**Breaking changes:**
  * üêç As [announced last month](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-will-deprecate-python-2-in-february/1656), **Streamlit no longer supports Python 2.** To use Streamlit you'll need Python 3.5 or above.

_Release date: February 4, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * üì∫ **Ability to record screencasts directly from Streamlit!** This allows you to easily record and share explanations about your models, analyses, data, etc. Just click ‚ò∞ then "Record a screencast". Give it a try!


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0540)Version 0.54.0
_Release date: January 29, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * ‚å®Ô∏è Support for password fields! Just pass `type="password"` to `st.text_input()`.


**Notable fixes:**
  * ‚ú≥Ô∏è Numerous st.cache improvements, including better support for complex objects.
  * üó£Ô∏è Fixed cross-talk in sidebar between multiple users.


**Breaking changes:**
  * If you're using the SessionState ~~hack~~ Gist, you should re-download it! Depending on which hack you're using, here are some links to save you some time: 
    * [SessionState.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/036da038ab3e999a64497f42de966a92)
    * [st_state_patch.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/0899a5cdc9f0467f7622750896e6bd7f)


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2020#version-0530)Version 0.53.0
_Release date: January 14, 2020_
**Highlights:**
  * üó∫Ô∏è Support for all DeckGL features! Just use [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of [`st.deck_gl_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart). To do that, simply pass a PyDeck object to [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart), [`st.write`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.write), or [magic](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#magic).
_Note that as a**preview release** things may change in the near future. Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the API!_
**The goals is for this to replace`st.deck_gl_chart` ,** since it is does everything the old API did _and much more!_
  * üÜï Better handling of Streamlit upgrades while developing. We now auto-reload the browser tab if the app it is displaying uses a newer version of Streamlit than the one the tab is running.
  * üëë New favicon, with our new logo!


**Notable fixes:**
  * Magic now works correctly in Python 3.8. It no longer causes docstrings to render in your app.


**Breaking changes:**
  * Updated how we calculate the default width and height of all chart types. We now leave chart sizing up to your charting library itself, so please refer to the library's documentation.
As a result, the `width` and `height` arguments have been deprecated from most chart commands, and `use_container_width` has been introduced everywhere to allow you to make charts fill as much horizontal space as possible (this used to be the default).

  9. Change `st.write` to `st.title` and save your file:
`import streamlit as st st.title("Hello World") `
  10. In your browser, click "**Always rerun** " to instantly rerun your app whenever you save a change to your file. ![Automatically rerun your app when your source file changes](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/get-started/hello-world-6-always-rerun.png)
  11. Your app will update! Keep making changes and you will see your changes as soon as you save your file. ![Your app updates when you resave your source file](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/get-started/hello-world-7-updated-app.png)
  12. When you're done, you can stop your app with `Ctrl+C` in your terminal or just by closing your terminal.

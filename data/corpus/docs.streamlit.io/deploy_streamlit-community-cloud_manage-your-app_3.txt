Title: Managing Your Streamlit App in Community Cloud
URL: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app
Summary: This section outlines how to manage your Streamlit app from the app chrome accessible at your custom subdomain. Although deployment options are removed, users can still clear their cache. Additionally, it explains that updates to the app can be made directly through GitHub, with changes reflecting immediately upon pushing to the repository.

From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, you can always access the [app chrome](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome) just like you can when developing locally. The option to deploy your app is removed, but you can still clear your cache from here.

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#update-your-app)Update your app
Your GitHub repository is the source for your app, so that means that any time you push an update to your repository you'll see it reflected in the app in almost real time. Try it out!
Streamlit also smartly detects whether you touched your dependencies, in which case it will automatically do a full redeploy for youâ€”which will take a little more time. But since most updates don't involve dependency changes, you should usually see your app update in real time.
### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#add-or-remove-dependencies)Add or remove dependencies
To add or remove dependencies at any point, just update `requirements.txt` (Python dependenciess) or `packages.txt` (Linux dependencies), and commit the changes to your repository on GitHub. Community Cloud detects the change in your dependencies and automatically triggers (re)installation.
It is best practice to pin your Streamlit version in `requirements.txt`. Otherwise, the version may be auto-upgraded at any point without your knowledge, which could lead to undesired results (e.g. when we deprecate a feature in Streamlit).

### [](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#resource-limits)Resource limits
All Community Cloud users have access to the same resources and are subject to the same limits. These limits may change at any time without notice. If your app meets or exceeds its limits, it may slow down from throttling or become nonfunctional. The limits as of February 2024 are approximately as follows:
  * CPU: 0.078 cores minimum, 2 cores maximum
  * Memory: 690MB minimum, 2.7GBs maximum
  * Storage: No minimum, 50GB maximum


Symptoms that your app is running out of resources include the following:
  * Your app is running slowly.
  * Your app displays "ðŸ¤¯ This app has gone over its resource limits."
  * Your app displays "ðŸ˜¦ Oh no."

Streamlit offers increased resources for apps with good-for-the-world use cases. Generally, these apps are used by an educational institution or nonprofit organization, are part of an open-source project, or benefit the world in some way. If your app is **not** primarily used by a for-profit company you can [apply for increased resources](https://info.snowflake.com/streamlit-resource-increase-request.html).

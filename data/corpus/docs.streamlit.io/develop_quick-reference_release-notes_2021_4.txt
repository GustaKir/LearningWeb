**Features**

## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2021#version-0770)Version 0.77.0
_Release date: Feb 23, 2021_
**Features**
  * Added a new config option `client.showErrorDetails` allowing the developer to control the granularity of error messages. This is useful for when you deploy an app, and want to conceal from your users potentially-sensitive information contained in tracebacks.


**Notable bug fixes**
  * Fixed [bug](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1957) where `st.image` wasn't rendering certain kinds of SVGs correctly.
  * Fixed [regression](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2699) where the current value of an `st.slider` was only shown on hover.


## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/release-notes/2021#version-0760)Version 0.76.0
_Release date: February 4, 2021_
**Notable Changes**
  * 🎨 [`st.color_picker`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.color_picker) is now out of beta. This means the old beta_color_picker function, which was marked as deprecated for the past 3 months, has now been replaced with color_picker.
  * 🐍 Display a warning when a Streamlit script is run directly as `python script.py`.
  * [`st.image`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.image)'s `use_column_width` now defaults to an `auto` option which will resize the image to the column width if the image exceeds the column width.
  * ✂️ Fixed bugs ([2437](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2437) and [2247](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2247)) with content getting cut off within a [`st.beta_expander`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.beta_expander)
  * 📜 Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2543) in [`st.dataframe`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.dataframe) where the scrollbar overlapped with the contents in the last column.
  * 💾 Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2561) for [`st.file_uploader`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader) where file data returned was not the most recently uploaded file.
  * ➕ Fixed bugs ([2086](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2086) and [2556](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2556)) where some LaTeX commands were not rendering correctly.

# [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/https-support#https-support)HTTPS support
Many apps need to be accessed with SSL / [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) protocol or `https://`.
We recommend performing SSL termination in a reverse proxy or load balancer for self-hosted and production use cases, not directly in the app. [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud) uses this approach, and every major cloud and app hosting platform should allow you to configure it and provide extensive documentation. You can find some of these platforms in our [Deployment tutorials](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/tutorials).
To terminate SSL in your Streamlit app, you must configure `server.sslCertFile` and `server.sslKeyFile`. Learn how to set config options in [Configuration](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration).
## [](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/https-support#details-on-usage)Details on usage
  * The configuration value should be a local file path to a cert file and key file. These must be available at the time the app starts.
  * Both `server.sslCertFile` and `server.sslKeyFile` must be specified. If only one is specified, your app will exit with an error.
  * This feature will not work in Community Cloud. Community Cloud already serves your app with TLS.

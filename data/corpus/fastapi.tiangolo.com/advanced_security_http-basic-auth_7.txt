Title: HTTP Basic Authentication in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/http-basic-auth/
Summary: This documentation chunk provides an example of implementing HTTP Basic Authentication in a FastAPI application. It includes the setup for verifying user credentials using secrets for comparison, raising an HTTP 401 error for incorrect username or password, and demonstrates how to retrieve the current username through a dependency.

```
importsecrets
fromfastapiimport Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
fromfastapi.securityimport HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials
app = FastAPI()
security = HTTPBasic()
defget_current_username(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):
  current_username_bytes = credentials.username.encode("utf8")
  correct_username_bytes = b"stanleyjobson"
  is_correct_username = secrets.compare_digest(
    current_username_bytes, correct_username_bytes
  )
  current_password_bytes = credentials.password.encode("utf8")
  correct_password_bytes = b"swordfish"
  is_correct_password = secrets.compare_digest(
    current_password_bytes, correct_password_bytes
  )
  if not (is_correct_username and is_correct_password):
    raise HTTPException(
      status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
      detail="Incorrect username or password",
      headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"},
    )
  return credentials.username
@app.get("/users/me")
defread_current_user(username: str = Depends(get_current_username)):
  return {"username": username}

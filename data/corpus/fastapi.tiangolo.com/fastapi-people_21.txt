## About the data - technical details[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#about-the-data-technical-details "Permanent link")
The main intention of this page is to highlight the effort of the community to help others.
Especially including efforts that are normally less visible, and in many cases more arduous, like helping others with questions and reviewing Pull Requests with translations.
The data is calculated each month, you can read the [source code here](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/scripts/).
Here I'm also highlighting contributions from sponsors.
I also reserve the right to update the algorithm, sections, thresholds, etc (just in case ðŸ¤·).

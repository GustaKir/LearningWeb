Title: Working with File Uploads in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/
Summary: This document demonstrates handling file uploads in FastAPI using two endpoints: one for uploading files as raw bytes and another for uploading files as UploadFile objects. It also includes an HTML form for users to upload multiple files.
---

```
fromtypingimport List
fromfastapiimport FastAPI, File, UploadFile
fromfastapi.responsesimport HTMLResponse
app = FastAPI()
@app.post("/files/")
async defcreate_files(
  files: List[bytes] = File(description="Multiple files as bytes"),
):
  return {"file_sizes": [len(file) for file in files]}
@app.post("/uploadfiles/")
async defcreate_upload_files(
  files: List[UploadFile] = File(description="Multiple files as UploadFile"),
):
  return {"filenames": [file.filename for file in files]}
@app.get("/")
async defmain():
  content = """
<body>
<form action="/files/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input name="files" type="file" multiple>
<input type="submit">
</form>
<form action="/uploadfiles/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input name="files" type="file" multiple>
<input type="submit">
</form>
</body>
  """
  return HTMLResponse(content=content)

```

## Recap[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/#recap "Permanent link")
Use `File`, `bytes`, and `UploadFile` to declare files to be uploaded in the request, sent as form data.

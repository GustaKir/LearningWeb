Title: GZip Middleware Configuration
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/middleware/
Summary: This section details the configuration options for GZip middleware in FastAPI, including 'minimum_size' and 'compresslevel'. It also provides references to other ASGI middlewares, such as Uvicorn's ProxyHeadersMiddleware and MessagePack, encouraging readers to explore Starlette's Middleware documentation and the ASGI Awesome List for more options.

The following arguments are supported:
  * `minimum_size` - Do not GZip responses that are smaller than this minimum size in bytes. Defaults to `500`.
  * `compresslevel` - Used during GZip compression. It is an integer ranging from 1 to 9. Defaults to `9`. Lower value results in faster compression but larger file sizes, while higher value results in slower compression but smaller file sizes.


## Other middlewares[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/middleware/#other-middlewares "Permanent link")
There are many other ASGI middlewares.
For example:
  * [Uvicorn's `ProxyHeadersMiddleware`](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/uvicorn/middleware/proxy_headers.py)
  * [MessagePack](https://github.com/florimondmanca/msgpack-asgi)

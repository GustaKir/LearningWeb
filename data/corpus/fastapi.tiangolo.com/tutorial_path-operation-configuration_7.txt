Title: Path Operation Configuration in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/
Summary: This section discusses the use of response descriptions in FastAPI's path operations and how to deprecate a path operation without removing it. It highlights that FastAPI will auto-generate a default response description if none is provided, and provides code examples for marking operations as deprecated.
---

```

Info
Notice that `response_description` refers specifically to the response, the `description` refers to the _path operation_ in general.
Check
OpenAPI specifies that each _path operation_ requires a response description.
So, if you don't provide one, **FastAPI** will automatically generate one of "Successful response".

## Deprecate a _path operation_[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#deprecate-a-path-operation "Permanent link")
If you need to mark a _path operation_ as deprecated, but without removing it, pass the parameter `deprecated`:
[Python 3.8+](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#__tabbed_12_1)
```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/", tags=["items"])
async defread_items():
  return [{"name": "Foo", "price": 42}]
@app.get("/users/", tags=["users"])
async defread_users():
  return [{"username": "johndoe"}]
@app.get("/elements/", tags=["items"], deprecated=True)
async defread_elements():
  return [{"item_id": "Foo"}]

```

It will be clearly marked as deprecated in the interactive docs:

Check how deprecated and non-deprecated _path operations_ look like:

## Recap[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#recap "Permanent link")
You can configure and add metadata for your _path operations_ easily by passing parameters to the _path operation decorators_.

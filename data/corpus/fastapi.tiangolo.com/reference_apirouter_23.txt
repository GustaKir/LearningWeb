Title: Defining Path Operations in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/apirouter/
Summary: This section explains how to define path operations in FastAPI using the `put` method, specifying the URL path and response model. The path represents the endpoint, while the response model determines the structure of the response, which can be any valid Pydantic type. It covers aspects like documentation generation, serialization of returned objects, and filtering of response data based on the defined model.

```
defput(
  self,
  path: Annotated[
    str,
    Doc(
"""
      The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.
      For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.
      """
    ),
  ],
  *,
  response_model: Annotated[
    Any,
    Doc(
"""
      The type to use for the response.
      It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
      be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
      etc.
      It will be used for:
      * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
      * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
        corresponding JSON.
      * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
        that `password`.
      * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

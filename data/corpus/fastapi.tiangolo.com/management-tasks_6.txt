Title: Management of Translation Pull Requests
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/
Summary: The `awaiting-review` label is used for translations and triggers a GitHub Action to manage review notifications. Once reviewed and approved by a native speaker, the label changes to `approved-1`. The process for merging PRs includes confirming the title and ensuring correct language labels are applied.
---

The label `awaiting-review` is special, only used for translations. A GitHub Action will detect it, then it will read the language label, and it will update the GitHub Discussions managing the translations for that language to notify people that there's a new translation to review.
Once a native speaker comes, reviews the PR, and approves it, the GitHub Action will come and remove the `awaiting-review` label, and add the `approved-1` label.
This way, we can notice when there are new translations ready, because they have the `approved-1` label.
## Merge Translation PRs[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#merge-translation-prs "Permanent link")
For Spanish, as I'm a native speaker and it's a language close to me, I will give it a final review myself and in most cases tweak the PR a bit before merging it.
For the other languages, confirm that:
  * The title is correct following the instructions above.
  * It has the labels `lang-all` and `lang-{lang code}`.
  * The PR changes only one Markdown file adding a translation.
    * Or in some cases, at most two files, if they are small, for the same language, and people reviewed them.
    * If it's the first translation for that language, it will have additional `mkdocs.yml` files, for those cases follow the instructions below.
  * The PR doesn't add any additional or extraneous files.
  * The translation seems to have a similar structure as the original English file.
  * The translation doesn't seem to change the original content, for example with obvious additional documentation sections.
  * The translation doesn't use different Markdown structures, for example adding HTML tags when the original didn't have them.
  * The "admonition" sections, like `tip`, `info`, etc. are not changed or translated. For example:


```
/// tip
This is a tip.
///

```

looks like this:
Tip
This is a tip.
...it could be translated as:
```
/// tip
Esto es un consejo.
///

```

...but needs to keep the exact `tip` keyword. If it was translated to `consejo`, like:
```
/// consejo
Esto es un consejo.
///

```

it would change the style to the default one, it would look like:
/// consejo
Esto es un consejo.
///
Those don't have to be translated, but if they are, they need to be written as:
```
/// tip | consejo
Esto es un consejo.
///

```

Which looks like:
consejo
Esto es un consejo.
## First Translation PR[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#first-translation-pr "Permanent link")
When there's a first translation for a language, it will have a `docs/{lang code}/docs/index.md` translated file and a `docs/{lang code}/mkdocs.yml`.
For example, for Bosnian, it would be:
  * `docs/bs/docs/index.md`
  * `docs/bs/mkdocs.yml`


The `mkdocs.yml` file will have only the following content:
```
INHERIT:../en/mkdocs.yml

```

The language code would normally be in the [ISO 639-1 list of language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
In any case, the language code should be in the file [docs/language_names.yml](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/docs/language_names.yml).
There won't be yet a label for the language code, for example, if it was Bosnian, there wouldn't be a `lang-bs`. Before creating the label and adding it to the PR, create the GitHub Discussion:
  * Go to the [Translations GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations)
  * Create a new discussion with the title `Bosnian Translations` (or the language name in English)
  * A description of:


```

Title: Handling HTTPS with TLS Termination Proxy in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/https/
Summary: The document emphasizes the importance of using a separate system to manage HTTPS through a TLS Termination Proxy instead of directly with the application server. It highlights that understanding HTTPS concepts is crucial for developers, and future chapters will provide examples of setting up HTTPS for FastAPI applications.

All this renewal process, while still serving the app, is one of the main reasons why you would want to have a **separate system to handle HTTPS** with a TLS Termination Proxy instead of just using the TLS certificates with the application server directly (e.g. Uvicorn).
## Recap[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/https/#recap "Permanent link")
Having **HTTPS** is very important, and quite **critical** in most cases. Most of the effort you as a developer have to put around HTTPS is just about **understanding these concepts** and how they work.
But once you know the basic information of **HTTPS for developers** you can easily combine and configure different tools to help you manage everything in a simple way.
In some of the next chapters, I'll show you several concrete examples of how to set up **HTTPS** for **FastAPI** applications. ðŸ”’

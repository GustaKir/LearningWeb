Title: Creating a Basic FastAPI Application
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/
Summary: This section explains how to define a simple FastAPI application that responds to GET requests at the root URL ('/') with a message. It demonstrates both synchronous and asynchronous function definitions for handling requests and mentions that various data types, including dictionaries, lists, and Pydantic models, can be returned.
---

```

This is a Python function.
It will be called by **FastAPI** whenever it receives a request to the URL "`/`" using a `GET` operation.
In this case, it is an `async` function.
You could also define it as a normal function instead of `async def`:
[Python 3.8+](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#__tabbed_6_1)
```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
defroot():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}

```

Note
If you don't know the difference, check the [Async: _"In a hurry?"_](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry).
### Step 5: return the content[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#step-5-return-the-content "Permanent link")
[Python 3.8+](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#__tabbed_7_1)
```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
async defroot():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}

```

You can return a `dict`, `list`, singular values as `str`, `int`, etc.
You can also return Pydantic models (you'll see more about that later).
There are many other objects and models that will be automatically converted to JSON (including ORMs, etc). Try using your favorite ones, it's highly probable that they are already supported.
## Recap[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#recap "Permanent link")
  * Import `FastAPI`.
  * Create an `app` instance.
  * Write a **path operation decorator** using decorators like `@app.get("/")`.
  * Define a **path operation function** ; for example, `def root(): ...`.
  * Run the development server using the command `fastapi dev`.

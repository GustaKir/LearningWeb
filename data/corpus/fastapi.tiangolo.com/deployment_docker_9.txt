## Interactive API docs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#interactive-api-docs "Permanent link")
Now you can go to <http://192.168.99.100/docs> or <http://127.0.0.1/docs> (or equivalent, using your Docker host).
You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)):

## Alternative API docs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#alternative-api-docs "Permanent link")
And you can also go to <http://192.168.99.100/redoc> or <http://127.0.0.1/redoc> (or equivalent, using your Docker host).
You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc)):

## Build a Docker Image with a Single-File FastAPI[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#build-a-docker-image-with-a-single-file-fastapi "Permanent link")
If your FastAPI is a single file, for example, `main.py` without an `./app` directory, your file structure could look like this:
```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt

```

Then you would just have to change the corresponding paths to copy the file inside the `Dockerfile`:
```
FROMpython:3.9
WORKDIR/code
COPY./requirements.txt/code/requirements.txt
RUNpipinstall--no-cache-dir--upgrade-r/code/requirements.txt
[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#__code_16_annotation_1)
COPY./main.py/code/
[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#__code_16_annotation_2)
CMD["fastapi","run","main.py","--port","80"]

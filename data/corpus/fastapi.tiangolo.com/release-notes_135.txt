## 0.60.2[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0602 "Permanent link")
  * Fix typo in docs for query parameters. PR [#1832](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1832) by [@ycd](https://github.com/ycd).
  * Add docs about [Async Tests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/async-tests/). PR [#1619](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1619) by [@empicano](https://github.com/empicano).
  * Raise an exception when using form data (`Form`, `File`) without having `python-multipart` installed.
    * Up to now the application would run, and raise an exception only when receiving a request with form data, the new behavior, raising early, will prevent from deploying applications with broken dependencies.
    * It also detects if the correct package `python-multipart` is installed instead of the incorrect `multipart` (both importable as `multipart`).

Title: Serving Static Files in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/
Summary: This section outlines how to serve static files in a FastAPI application by mounting a StaticFiles directory. It explains the concept of 'mounting' applications to handle independent paths and clarifies that FastAPI provides a convenience wrapper around Starlette's static file handling.
---

```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
fromfastapi.staticfilesimport StaticFiles
app = FastAPI()
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")

```

Technical Details
You could also use `from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles`.
**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.staticfiles` as `fastapi.staticfiles` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it actually comes directly from Starlette.
### What is "Mounting"[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/#what-is-mounting "Permanent link")
"Mounting" means adding a complete "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling all the sub-paths.
This is different from using an `APIRouter` as a mounted application is completely independent. The OpenAPI and docs from your main application won't include anything from the mounted application, etc.
You can read more about this in the [Advanced User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/).
## Details[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/#details "Permanent link")
The first `"/static"` refers to the sub-path this "sub-application" will be "mounted" on. So, any path that starts with `"/static"` will be handled by it.
The `directory="static"` refers to the name of the directory that contains your static files.
The `name="static"` gives it a name that can be used internally by **FastAPI**.
All these parameters can be different than "`static`", adjust them with the needs and specific details of your own application.

Title: FastAPI Release Notes 0.93.0
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: Version 0.93.0 introduces support for `lifespan` async context managers, replacing the previous `startup` and `shutdown` event methods. This allows developers to define lifecycle logic within a single function using the `@asynccontextmanager` decorator.

### Features[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#features_17 "Permanent link")
  * ✨ Add support for `lifespan` async context managers (superseding `startup` and `shutdown` events). Initial PR [#2944](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2944) by [@uSpike](https://github.com/uSpike).


Now, instead of using independent `startup` and `shutdown` events, you can define that logic in a single function with `yield` decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` (an async context manager).
For example:
```
fromcontextlibimport asynccontextmanager
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
deffake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
  return x * 42
ml_models = {}
@asynccontextmanager
async deflifespan(app: FastAPI):
  # Load the ML model
  ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
  yield
  # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
  ml_models.clear()
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
@app.get("/predict")
async defpredict(x: float):
  result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
  return {"result": result}

```

**Note** : This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using `startup` and `shutdown` events.

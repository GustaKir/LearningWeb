Title: Contribution Guidelines for FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/
Summary: This section outlines the process for contributing to FastAPI, specifically focusing on ensuring that pull requests (PRs) include tests, how to verify tests fail before and pass after the PR, and encouraging contributions such as documentation improvements or sharing external resources.
---

### Tests[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#tests "Permanent link")
  * Help me check that the PR has **tests**.
  * Check that the tests **fail** before the PR. 🚨
  * Then check that the tests **pass** after the PR. ✅
  * Many PRs don't have tests, you can **remind** them to add tests, or you can even **suggest** some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume most time and you can help a lot with that.
  * Then also comment what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓


## Create a Pull Request[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#create-a-pull-request "Permanent link")
You can [contribute](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/) to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:
  * To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
  * To share an article, video, or podcast you created or found about FastAPI by [editing this file](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/edit/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml).
    * Make sure you add your link to the start of the corresponding section.
  * To help [translate the documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#translations) to your language.
    * You can also help to review the translations created by others.
  * To propose new documentation sections.
  * To fix an existing issue/bug.
    * Make sure to add tests.
  * To add a new feature.
    * Make sure to add tests.
    * Make sure to add documentation if it's relevant.


## Help Maintain FastAPI[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-maintain-fastapi "Permanent link")
Help me maintain **FastAPI**! 🤓
There's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, **YOU** can do it.
The main tasks that you can do right now are:
  * [Help others with questions in GitHub](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-others-with-questions-in-github) (see the section above).
  * [Review Pull Requests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#review-pull-requests) (see the section above).


Those two tasks are what **consume time the most**. That's the main work of maintaining FastAPI.
If you can help me with that, **you are helping me maintain FastAPI** and making sure it keeps **advancing faster and better**. 🚀
## Join the chat[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#join-the-chat "Permanent link")
Join the 👥 [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmf) 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.
Tip
For questions, ask them in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions), there's a much better chance you will receive help by the [FastAPI Experts](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts).
Use the chat only for other general conversations.
### Don't use the chat for questions[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#dont-use-the-chat-for-questions "Permanent link")
Keep in mind that as chats allow more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.
In GitHub, the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅
Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub count to become a [FastAPI Expert](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts), so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub.
On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄
## Sponsor the author[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#sponsor-the-author "Permanent link")
You can also financially support the author (me) through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tiangolo).
There you could buy me a coffee ☕️ to say thanks. 😄
And you can also become a Silver or Gold sponsor for FastAPI. 🏅🎉

Title: FastAPI Path Operations Reference
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This document outlines the parameters for FastAPI path operations, focusing on 'path' and 'response_model'. The 'path' parameter specifies the URL path for the operation, while 'response_model' determines the response type, facilitating documentation generation, serialization, filtering, and validation of returned data.

PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION  
---|---  
`path` |  The URL path to be used for this _path operation_. For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`. **TYPE:** `str`  
`response_model` |  The type to use for the response. It could be any valid Pydantic _field_ type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc. It will be used for:
  * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will show it as the response (JSON Schema).
  * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the corresponding JSON.
  * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have that `password`.
  * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client, so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/). **TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`  
`status_code` |  The default status code to be used for the response. You could override the status code by returning a response directly. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/). **TYPE:** `Optional[int]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`tags` |  A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags). **TYPE:** `Optional[List[Union[str, Enum]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`dependencies` |  A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/). **TYPE:** `Optional[Sequence[Depends]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`summary` |  A summary for the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`description` |  A description for the _path operation_. If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_. It can contain Markdown. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_description` |  The description for the default response. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`  
`responses` |  Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`deprecated` |  Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `Optional[bool]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`operation_id` |  Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_. By default, it is generated automatically. If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API. You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_include` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `Optional[IncEx]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_exclude` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#

URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/
Summary: This section discusses how to manage dependencies for a group of path operations in FastAPI, including declaring a single 'dependencies' parameter for multiple operations and introducing global dependencies that apply to the entire FastAPI application.

Later, when reading about how to structure bigger applications ([Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/)), possibly with multiple files, you will learn how to declare a single `dependencies` parameter for a group of _path operations_.
## Global Dependencies[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/#global-dependencies "Permanent link")
Next we will see how to add dependencies to the whole `FastAPI` application, so that they apply to each _path operation_.

# Repository Management[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/#repository-management "Permanent link")
Here's a short description of how the FastAPI repository is managed and maintained.
## Owner[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/#owner "Permanent link")
I, [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), am the creator and owner of the FastAPI repository. 🤓
I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). 😅
## Team[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/#team "Permanent link")
There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎
They have different levels of permissions and [specific instructions](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/).
Some of the tasks they can perform include:
  * Adding labels to PRs.
  * Editing PR titles.
  * Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
  * Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
  * Merge some specific types of PRs.


You can see the current team members in [FastAPI People - Team](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#team).
Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.
## FastAPI Experts[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/#fastapi-experts "Permanent link")
The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become [**FastAPI Experts**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts).
This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.
## External Contributions[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/#external-contributions "Permanent link")
External contributions are very welcome and appreciated, including answering questions, submitting PRs, etc. 🙇‍♂️

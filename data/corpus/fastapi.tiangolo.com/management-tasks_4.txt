# Repository Management Tasks[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#repository-management-tasks "Permanent link")
These are the tasks that can be performed to manage the FastAPI repository by [team members](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#team).
Tip
This section is useful only to a handful of people, team members with permissions to manage the repository. You can probably skip it. 😉
...so, you are a [team member of FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#team)? Wow, you are so cool! 😎
You can help with everything on [Help FastAPI - Get Help](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/) the same ways as external contributors. But additionally, there are some tasks that only you (as part of the team) can perform.
Here are the general instructions for the tasks you can perform.
Thanks a lot for your help. 🙇
## Be Nice[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#be-nice "Permanent link")
First of all, be nice. 😊
You probably are super nice if you were added to the team, but it's worth mentioning it. 🤓
### When Things are Difficult[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#when-things-are-difficult "Permanent link")
When things are great, everything is easier, so that doesn't need much instructions. But when things are difficult, here are some guidelines.
Try to find the good side. In general, if people are not being unfriendly, try to thank their effort and interest, even if you disagree with the main subject (discussion, PR), just thank them for being interested in the project, or for having dedicated some time to try to do something.
It's difficult to convey emotion in text, use emojis to help. 😅
In discussions and PRs, in many cases, people bring their frustration and show it without filter, in many cases exaggerating, complaining, being entitled, etc. That's really not nice, and when it happens, it lowers our priority to solve their problems. But still, try to breath, and be gentle with your answers.
Try to avoid using bitter sarcasm or potentially passive-aggressive comments. If something is wrong, it's better to be direct (try to be gentle) than sarcastic.
Try to be as specific and objective as possible, avoid generalizations.
For conversations that are more difficult, for example to reject a PR, you can ask me (@tiangolo) to handle it directly.
## Edit PR Titles[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/#edit-pr-titles "Permanent link")
  * Edit the PR title to start with an emoji from [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).
    * Use the emoji character, not the GitHub code. So, use `🐛` instead of `:bug:`. This is so that it shows up correctly outside of GitHub, for example in the release notes.
    * For translations use the `🌐` emoji ("globe with meridians").
  * Start the title with a verb. For example `Add`, `Refactor`, `Fix`, etc. This way the title will say the action that the PR does. Like `Add support for teleporting`, instead of `Teleporting wasn't working, so this PR fixes it`.
  * Edit the text of the PR title to start in "imperative", like giving an order. So, instead of `Adding support for teleporting` use `Add support for teleporting`.
  * Try to make the title descriptive about what it achieves. If it's a feature, try to describe it, for example `Add support for teleporting` instead of `Create TeleportAdapter class`.
  * Do not finish the title with a period (`.`).
  * When the PR is for a translation, start with the `🌐` and then `Add {language} translation for` and then the translated file path. For example:


```
🌐 Add Spanish translation for `docs/es/docs/teleporting.md`

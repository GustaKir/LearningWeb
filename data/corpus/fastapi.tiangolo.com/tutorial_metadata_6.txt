Title: Configuring OpenAPI and Documentation Interfaces in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/
Summary: This section explains how to disable the OpenAPI schema by setting `openapi_url=None`, which also disables related documentation interfaces. It details how to configure Swagger UI and ReDoc, including how to set their URLs or disable them using `docs_url` and `redoc_url` parameters respectively. An example demonstrates changing the Swagger UI path and disabling ReDoc.

```

If you want to disable the OpenAPI schema completely you can set `openapi_url=None`, that will also disable the documentation user interfaces that use it.
## Docs URLs[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/#docs-urls "Permanent link")
You can configure the two documentation user interfaces included:
  * **Swagger UI** : served at `/docs`.
    * You can set its URL with the parameter `docs_url`.
    * You can disable it by setting `docs_url=None`.
  * **ReDoc** : served at `/redoc`.
    * You can set its URL with the parameter `redoc_url`.
    * You can disable it by setting `redoc_url=None`.


For example, to set Swagger UI to be served at `/documentation` and disable ReDoc:
[Python 3.8+](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/#__tabbed_6_1)
```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI(docs_url="/documentation", redoc_url=None)
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items():
  return [{"name": "Foo"}]

```

Title: APIRouter Initialization in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/apirouter/
Summary: This documentation chunk outlines the `__init__` method for the APIRouter class in FastAPI, detailing optional parameters such as `prefix` for path prefixes, `tags` for applying common tags to path operations, and `dependencies` for shared dependencies in the router. It also references additional resources for deeper understanding of path operation configuration and using APIRouter in larger applications.

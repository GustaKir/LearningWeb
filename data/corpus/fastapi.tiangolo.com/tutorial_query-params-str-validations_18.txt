You can declare additional validations and metadata for your parameters.
Generic validations and metadata:

  * `title`
  * `description`
  * `deprecated`


Validations specific for strings:
  * `min_length`
  * `max_length`
  * `pattern`


Custom validations using `AfterValidator`.
In these examples you saw how to declare validations for `str` values.

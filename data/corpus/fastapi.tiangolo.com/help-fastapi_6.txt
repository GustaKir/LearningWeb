Here's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):
### Understand the question[¬∂](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#understand-the-question "Permanent link")
  * Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person asking.
  * Then check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is **clear**.
  * In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**.
  * If you can't understand the question, ask for more **details**.

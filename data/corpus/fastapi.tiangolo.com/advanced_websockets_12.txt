Title: WebSocket Handling in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/
Summary: This section provides a simple example of how to handle and broadcast messages to multiple WebSocket connections in FastAPI. It highlights the limitations of using an in-memory list, which only works during the process's runtime and with a single process. For a more robust solution, it suggests integrating with tools like Redis or PostgreSQL via the encode/broadcaster. Additional resources are available in Starlette's documentation.

Tip
The app above is a minimal and simple example to demonstrate how to handle and broadcast messages to several WebSocket connections.
But keep in mind that, as everything is handled in memory, in a single list, it will only work while the process is running, and will only work with a single process.
If you need something easy to integrate with FastAPI but that is more robust, supported by Redis, PostgreSQL or others, check [encode/broadcaster](https://github.com/encode/broadcaster).

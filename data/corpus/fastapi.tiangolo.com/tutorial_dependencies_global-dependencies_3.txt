# Global Dependencies[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/global-dependencies/#global-dependencies "Permanent link")
For some types of applications you might want to add dependencies to the whole application.
Similar to the way you can [add `dependencies` to the _path operation decorators_](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/), you can add them to the `FastAPI` application.
In that case, they will be applied to all the _path operations_ in the application:

### Translations[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#translations "Permanent link")
Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can't be done without the help from the community. ðŸŒŽ ðŸš€
Here are the steps to help with translations.
#### Tips and guidelines[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#tips-and-guidelines "Permanent link")
  * Check the currently [existing pull requests](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls) for your language. You can filter the pull requests by the ones with the label for your language. For example, for Spanish, the label is [`lang-es`](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-es+label%3Aawaiting-review).
  * Review those pull requests, requesting changes or approving them. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging.


Tip
You can [add comments with change suggestions](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) to existing pull requests.
Check the docs about [adding a pull request review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to approve it or request changes.
  * Check if there's a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations) to coordinate translations for your language. You can subscribe to it, and when there's a new pull request to review, an automatic comment will be added to the discussion.
  * If you translate pages, add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it.
  * To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate, you can use the table [List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).


#### Existing language[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#existing-language "Permanent link")
Let's say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish.
In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is `es`. So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at `docs/es/`.
Tip
The main ("official") language is English, located at `docs/en/`.
Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish:
```

fast â†’[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)ðŸ’¬ Use the command "live" and pass the language code as a CLI argumentpython ./scripts/docs.py live es[INFO] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008[INFO] Start watching changes[INFO] Start detecting changesrestart â†»[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

```

Tip
Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.
Go into the language directory, for the Spanish translations it's at `docs/es/`:
```
$ cddocs/es/

```

Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:
```
$ mkdocsserve--dev-addr127.0.0.1:8008

```

Now you can go to <http://127.0.0.1:8008> and see your changes live.
You will see that every language has all the pages. But some pages are not translated and have an info box at the top, about the missing translation.
Now let's say that you want to add a translation for the section [Features](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/).
  * Copy the file at:


```
docs/en/docs/features.md

```

  * Paste it in exactly the same location but for the language you want to translate, e.g.:


```
docs/es/docs/features.md

```

Tip
Notice that the only change in the path and file name is the language code, from `en` to `es`.
If you go to your browser you will see that now the docs show your new section (the info box at the top is gone). ðŸŽ‰
Now you can translate it all and see how it looks as you save the file.
#### Don't Translate these Pages[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#dont-translate-these-pages "Permanent link")
ðŸš¨ Don't translate:
  * Files under `reference/`
  * `release-notes.md`
  * `fastapi-people.md`
  * `external-links.md`
  * `newsletter.md`
  * `management-tasks.md`
  * `management.md`
  * `contributing.md`


Some of these files are updated very frequently and a translation would always be behind, or they include the main content from English source files, etc.
#### New Language[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#new-language "Permanent link")
Let's say that you want to add translations for a language that is not yet translated, not even some pages.
Let's say you want to add translations for Creole, and it's not yet there in the docs.
Checking the link from above, the code for "Creole" is `ht`.
The next step is to run the script to generate a new translation directory:
```

fast â†’[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)ðŸ’¬ Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argumentpython ./scripts/docs.py new-lang htSuccessfully initialized: docs/htrestart â†»[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

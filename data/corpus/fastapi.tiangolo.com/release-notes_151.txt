## 0.32.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0320 "Permanent link")
  * Fix typo in docs for features. PR [#380](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/380) by [@MartinoMensio](https://github.com/MartinoMensio).
  * Fix source code `limit` for example in [Query Parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/). PR [#366](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/366) by [@Smashman](https://github.com/Smashman).
  * Update wording in docs about [OAuth2 scopes](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/). PR [#371](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/371) by [@cjw296](https://github.com/cjw296).
  * Update docs for `Enum`s to inherit from `str` and improve Swagger UI rendering. PR [#351](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/351).
  * Fix regression, add Swagger UI deep linking again. PR [#350](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/350).
  * Add test for having path templates in `prefix` of `.include_router`. PR [#349](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/349).
  * Add note to docs: [Include the same router multiple times with different `prefix`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-the-same-router-multiple-times-with-different-prefix). PR [#348](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/348).
  * Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
    * Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
    * The same new ID generation applies to response models.
    * This also changes the generated title for those models.
    * Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
    * This also adds the possibility of using `.include_router()` with the same `APIRouter` _multiple_ times, with different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v2` and `/api/latest`, and it will now work correctly.
    * PR [#347](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/347).

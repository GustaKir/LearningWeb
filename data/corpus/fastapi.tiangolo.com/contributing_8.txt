Title: Creating and Previewing Documentation for FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/
Summary: This section explains how to create a new directory for translations in the FastAPI documentation, including generating a configuration file and a dummy index page. It also provides tips for manual creation of files and instructions for previewing the documentation using scripts or `mkdocs`.
---

```

Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory `docs/ht/`.
That command created a file `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` with a simple config that inherits everything from the `en` version:
```
INHERIT:../en/mkdocs.yml

```

Tip
You could also simply create that file with those contents manually.
That command also created a dummy file `docs/ht/index.md` for the main page, you can start by translating that one.
You can continue with the previous instructions for an "Existing Language" for that process.
You can make the first pull request with those two files, `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` and `docs/ht/index.md`. ðŸŽ‰
#### Preview the result[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#preview-the-result "Permanent link")
As already mentioned above, you can use the `./scripts/docs.py` with the `live` command to preview the results (or `mkdocs serve`).
Once you are done, you can also test it all as it would look online, including all the other languages.
To do that, first build all the docs:
```

fast â†’[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)ðŸ’¬ Use the command "build-all", this will take a bitpython ./scripts/docs.py build-allBuilding docs for: enBuilding docs for: esSuccessfully built docs for: esrestart â†»[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

```

This builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at `./site/`.
Then you can serve that with the command `serve`:
```

fast â†’[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)ðŸ’¬ Use the command "serve" after running "build-all"python ./scripts/docs.py serveWarning: this is a very simple server. For development, use mkdocs serve instead.This is here only to preview a site with translations already built.Make sure you run the build-all command first.Serving at: http://127.0.0.1:8008restart â†»[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

```

#### Translation specific tips and guidelines[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#translation-specific-tips-and-guidelines "Permanent link")
  * Translate only the Markdown documents (`.md`). Do not translate the code examples at `./docs_src`.
  * In code blocks within the Markdown document, translate comments (`# a comment`), but leave the rest unchanged.
  * Do not change anything enclosed in "``" (inline code).
  * In lines starting with `///` translate only the text part after `|`. Leave the rest unchanged.
  * You can translate info boxes like `/// warning` with for example `/// warning | Achtung`. But do not change the word immediately after the `///`, it determines the color of the info box.
  * Do not change the paths in links to images, code files, Markdown documents.
  * However, when a Markdown document is translated, the `#hash-parts` in links to its headings may change. Update these links if possible.
    * Search for such links in the translated document using the regex `#[^# ]`.
    * Search in all documents already translated into your language for `your-translated-document.md`. For example VS Code has an option "Edit" -> "Find in Files".
    * When translating a document, do not "pre-translate" `#hash-parts` that link to headings in untranslated documents.

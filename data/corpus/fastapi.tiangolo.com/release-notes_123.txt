## 0.65.3[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0653 "Permanent link")
### Fixes[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#fixes_31 "Permanent link")
  * ♻ Assume request bodies contain JSON when no Content-Type header is provided. This fixes a breaking change introduced by [0.65.2 with PR #2118](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2118). It should allow upgrading FastAPI applications with clients that send JSON data without a `Content-Type` header. And there's still protection against CSRFs.

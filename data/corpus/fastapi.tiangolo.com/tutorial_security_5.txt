URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/
Summary: FastAPI allows for easy integration of authentication and authorization providers like Google and GitHub. It provides tools in the `fastapi.security` module to simplify the implementation of various security mechanisms, which are also integrated into the interactive documentation system.

Tip
Integrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy.
The most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but **FastAPI** gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.
## **FastAPI** utilities[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/#fastapi-utilities "Permanent link")
FastAPI provides several tools for each of these security schemes in the `fastapi.security` module that simplify using these security mechanisms.
In the next chapters you will see how to add security to your API using those tools provided by **FastAPI**.
And you will also see how it gets automatically integrated into the interactive documentation system.

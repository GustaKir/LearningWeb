Title: FastAPI Response Model and Configuration
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This section covers various attributes for configuring response models in FastAPI, including 'response_model,' 'status_code,' 'tags,' and 'dependencies.' Each attribute's type and default values are provided, along with links to detailed documentation for further reading.
---

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/). **TYPE:** `Any` **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)`  
`status_code` |  The default status code to be used for the response. You could override the status code by returning a response directly. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/). **TYPE:** `Optional[int]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`tags` |  A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags). **TYPE:** `Optional[List[Union[str, Enum]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`dependencies` |  A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/). **TYPE:** `Optional[Sequence[Depends]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`summary` |  A summary for the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`description` |  A description for the _path operation_. If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_. It can contain Markdown. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_description` |  The description for the default response. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`  
`responses` |  Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`deprecated` |  Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `Optional[bool]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`operation_id` |  Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_. By default, it is generated automatically. If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API. You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_include` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `Optional[IncEx]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_exclude` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `Optional[IncEx]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_by_alias` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`  
`response_model_exclude_unset` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default. When `True`, default values are omitted from the response. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`  
`response_model_exclude_defaults` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exc

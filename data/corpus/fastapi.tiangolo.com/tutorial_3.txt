It is also built to work as a future reference so you can come back and see exactly what you need.
## Run the code[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#run-the-code "Permanent link")
All the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).
To run any of the examples, copy the code to a file `main.py`, and start `fastapi dev` with:

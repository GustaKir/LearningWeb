# Development - Contributing[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#development-contributing "Permanent link")
First, you might want to see the basic ways to [help FastAPI and get help](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/).
## Developing[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#developing "Permanent link")
If you already cloned the [fastapi repository](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) and you want to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.
### Virtual environment[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#virtual-environment "Permanent link")
Follow the instructions to create and activate a [virtual environment](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/) for the internal code of `fastapi`.
### Install requirements using pip[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#install-requirements-using-pip "Permanent link")
After activating the environment, install the required packages:
```

fast →[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)pip install -r requirements.txtrestart ↻[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

```

It will install all the dependencies and your local FastAPI in your local environment.
### Using your local FastAPI[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#using-your-local-fastapi "Permanent link")
If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastAPI, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your cloned local FastAPI source code.
And if you update that local FastAPI source code when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastAPI you just edited.
That way, you don't have to "install" your local version to be able to test every change.
Technical Details
This only happens when you install using this included `requirements.txt` instead of running `pip install fastapi` directly.
That is because inside the `requirements.txt` file, the local version of FastAPI is marked to be installed in "editable" mode, with the `-e` option.
### Format the code[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#format-the-code "Permanent link")
There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code:
```

fast →[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)bash scripts/format.shrestart ↻[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

```

It will also auto-sort all your imports.
## Tests[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#tests "Permanent link")
There is a script that you can run locally to test all the code and generate coverage reports in HTML:
```

fast →[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)bash scripts/test-cov-html.shrestart ↻[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/)

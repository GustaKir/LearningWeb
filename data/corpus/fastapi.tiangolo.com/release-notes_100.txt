## 0.87.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0870 "Permanent link")
Highlights of this release:
  * [Upgraded Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette/releases/tag/0.21.0)
    * Now the `TestClient` is based on HTTPX instead of Requests. 🚀
    * There are some possible **breaking changes** in the `TestClient` usage, but [@Kludex](https://github.com/Kludex) built [bump-testclient](https://github.com/Kludex/bump-testclient) to help you automatize migrating your tests. Make sure you are using Git and that you can undo any unnecessary changes (false positive changes, etc) before using `bump-testclient`.
  * New [WebSocketException (and docs)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/#using-depends-and-others), re-exported from Starlette.
  * Upgraded and relaxed dependencies for package extras `all` (including new Uvicorn version), when you install `"fastapi[all]"`.
  * New docs about how to [**Help Maintain FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-maintain-fastapi).

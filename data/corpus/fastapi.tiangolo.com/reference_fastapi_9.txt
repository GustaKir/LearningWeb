Title: FastAPI Configuration Options
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This section discusses the configuration options for FastAPI, specifically the deprecated 'openapi_prefix' replaced by 'root_path', which provides a URL prefix for OpenAPI. It also covers 'root_path', which helps handle path prefixes for proxies, and 'root_path_in_servers', which controls the automatic generation of URLs in the 'servers' field of the OpenAPI documentation.
---

```
**TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, Any]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`openapi_prefix` |  "openapi_prefix" has been deprecated in favor of "root_path", which follows more closely the ASGI standard, is simpler, and more automatic. A URL prefix for the OpenAPI URL. **TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `''`  
`root_path` |  A path prefix handled by a proxy that is not seen by the application but is seen by external clients, which affects things like Swagger UI. Read more about it at the [FastAPI docs for Behind a Proxy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/). **Example** ```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI(root_path="/api/v1")

```
**TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `''`  
`root_path_in_servers` |  To disable automatically generating the URLs in the `servers` field in the autogenerated OpenAPI using the `root_path`. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Behind a Proxy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/#disable-automatic-server-from-root_path). **Example** ```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
app = FastAPI(root_path_in_servers=False)

```
**TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`  
`responses` |  Additional responses to be shown in OpenAPI. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Additional Responses in OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/). And in the [FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-custom-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies). **TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`callbacks` |  OpenAPI callbacks that should apply to all _path operations_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/). **TYPE:** `Optional[List[BaseRoute]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`webhooks` |  Add OpenAPI webhooks. This is similar to `callbacks` but it doesn't depend on specific _path operations_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **Note** : This is available since OpenAPI 3.1.0, FastAPI 0.99.0. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Webhooks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-webhooks/). **TYPE:** `Optional[APIRouter[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter "<code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class"></code>      <span class="doc doc-object-name doc-class-name">fastapi.APIRouter</span> \(<code>fastapi.routing.APIRouter</code>\)")]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`deprecated` |  Mark all _path operations_ as deprecated. You probably don't need it, but it's available. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `Optional[bool]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`include_in_schema` |  To include (or not) all the _path operations_ in the generated OpenAPI. You probably don't need it, but it's available. This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-from-openapi). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`  
`swagger_ui_parameters` |  Parameters to configure Swagger UI, the autogenerated interactive API documentation (by default at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Configure Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/configure-swagger-ui/). **TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`generate_unique_id_function` |  Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI. This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`  
`separate_input_output_schemas` |  Whether to generate separate OpenAPI schemas for request body and response body when the results would be more precise. This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients. For example, if you have a model like: ```
frompydanticimport BaseModel
classItem(BaseModel):
  name: str
  tags: list[str] = []

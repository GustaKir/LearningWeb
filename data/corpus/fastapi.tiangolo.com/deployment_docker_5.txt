# FastAPI in Containers - Docker[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#fastapi-in-containers-docker "Permanent link")
When deploying FastAPI applications a common approach is to build a **Linux container image**. It's normally done using [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/). You can then deploy that container image in one of a few possible ways.
Using Linux containers has several advantages including **security** , **replicability** , **simplicity** , and others.

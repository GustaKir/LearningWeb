Title: FastAPI Response Model Configuration
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This section outlines various configurations available for response models in FastAPI, including options for including or excluding fields, serializing by alias, and handling unset values. It details the types and default settings for each configuration option.
---

response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `Optional[IncEx]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`response_model_by_alias` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`  
`response_model_exclude_unset` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default. When `True`, default values are omitted from the response. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`  
`response_model_exclude_defaults` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response. When `True`, default values are omitted from the response. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`  
`response_model_exclude_none` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`. This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`  
`include_in_schema` |  Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema. This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-from-openapi). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`  
`response_class` |  Response class to be used for this _path operation_. This will not be used if you return a response directly. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse). **TYPE:** `Type[Response[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/response/#fastapi.Response "<code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class"></code>      <span class="doc doc-object-name doc-class-name">fastapi.Response</span> \(<code>starlette.responses.Response</code>\)")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(JSONResponse[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class"></code>      <span class="doc doc-object-name doc-class-name">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span> \(<code>starlette.responses.JSONResponse</code>\)"))`  
`name` |  Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally. **TYPE:** `Optional[str]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`callbacks` |  List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks. This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/). **TYPE:** `Optional[List[BaseRoute]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`openapi_extra` |  Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema). **TYPE:** `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` **DEFAULT:** `None`  
`generate_unique_id_function` |  Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI. This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

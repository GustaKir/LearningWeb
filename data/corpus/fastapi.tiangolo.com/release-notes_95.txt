Title: FastAPI Documentation Updates
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: FastAPI documentation has been extensively rewritten to utilize 'Annotated' for declaring parameters and dependencies, improving typing information for better editor support. The updates include around 23,000 new lines across docs, examples, and tests, with examples provided for each specific Python version.

```

...and `CurrentUser` has all the typing information as `User`, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and **FastAPI** will be able to understand the dependency defined in `Annotated`. 😎
Roughly **all the docs** have been rewritten to use `Annotated` as the main way to declare **parameters** and **dependencies**. All the **examples** in the docs now include a version with `Annotated` and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀
The key updated docs are:
  * Python Types Intro:
    * [Type Hints with Metadata Annotations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/#type-hints-with-metadata-annotations).
  * Tutorial:
    * [Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#additional-validation)
      * [Advantages of `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#advantages-of-annotated)
    * [Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#order-the-parameters-as-you-need-tricks)
      * [Better with `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#better-with-annotated)
    * [Dependencies - First Steps - Share `Annotated` dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/#share-annotated-dependencies)

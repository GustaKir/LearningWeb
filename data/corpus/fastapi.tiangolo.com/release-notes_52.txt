Title: FastAPI Release Notes - Updated Dependency Management
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: FastAPI has changed its dependency management approach, now requiring users to explicitly install standard dependencies via 'pip install "fastapi[standard]"'. This change addresses user inconvenience from including standard dependencies by default and aims to simplify the installation process.

  * And it upgrades `fastapi-cli[standard] >=0.0.5`.


#### Technical Details[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#technical-details "Permanent link")
Before this, `fastapi` would include the standard dependencies, with Uvicorn and the `fastapi-cli`, etc.
And `fastapi-slim` would not include those standard dependencies.
Now `fastapi` doesn't include those standard dependencies unless you install with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.
Before, you would install `pip install fastapi`, now you should include the `standard` optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those): `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.
This change is because having the standard optional dependencies installed by default was being inconvenient to several users, and having to install instead `fastapi-slim` was not being a feasible solution.

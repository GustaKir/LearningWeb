Title: Integrating Flask with FastAPI using WSGI Middleware
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/wsgi/
Summary: This document details how to integrate a Flask application into a FastAPI project using WSGIMiddleware. It provides code snippets that demonstrate how to set up a Flask app and mount it on a FastAPI app, allowing requests under the path `/v1/` to be handled by Flask while all other requests are managed by FastAPI.
---

```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
fromfastapi.middleware.wsgiimport WSGIMiddleware
fromflaskimport Flask, request
frommarkupsafeimport escape
flask_app = Flask(__name__)
@flask_app.route("/")
defflask_main():
  name = request.args.get("name", "World")
  return f"Hello, {escape(name)} from Flask!"
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/v2")
defread_main():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}
app.mount("/v1", WSGIMiddleware(flask_app))

```

## Check it[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/wsgi/#check-it "Permanent link")
Now, every request under the path `/v1/` will be handled by the Flask application.
And the rest will be handled by **FastAPI**.
If you run it and go to <http://localhost:8000/v1/> you will see the response from Flask:
```
Hello, World from Flask!

```

And if you go to <http://localhost:8000/v2> you will see the response from FastAPI:
```
{
"message":"Hello World"
}

```

## Other Swagger UI Parameters[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/configure-swagger-ui/#other-swagger-ui-parameters "Permanent link")
To see all the other possible configurations you can use, read the official [docs for Swagger UI parameters](https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/).
## JavaScript-only settings[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/configure-swagger-ui/#javascript-only-settings "Permanent link")
Swagger UI also allows other configurations to be **JavaScript-only** objects (for example, JavaScript functions).
FastAPI also includes these JavaScript-only `presets` settings:
```
presets:[
SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis,
SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset
]

```

These are **JavaScript** objects, not strings, so you can't pass them from Python code directly.
If you need to use JavaScript-only configurations like those, you can use one of the methods above. Override all the Swagger UI _path operation_ and manually write any JavaScript you need.

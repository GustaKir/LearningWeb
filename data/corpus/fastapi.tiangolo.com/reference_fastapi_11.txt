Title: FastAPI Application Initialization Reference
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This chunk details the `__init__` method for initializing a FastAPI application. It covers parameters such as `debug`, indicating whether debug tracebacks are displayed on server errors, and `routes`, which is a list for handling HTTP and WebSocket requests. The use of `routes` is cautioned against for FastAPI, as it is primarily inherited from Starlette, suggesting the use of path operation methods instead.

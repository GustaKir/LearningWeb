...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the `contextvars` context was different, because of the way it was implemented.
**Note** : You probably don't need `contextvars`, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's `g` semi-global variable.

Title: Response Status Code in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/
Summary: This section discusses the convenience and usage of `starlette.status` and `fastapi.status` in FastAPI for handling response status codes. It notes that both provide the same functionality, aiding developers with autocomplete features. Additionally, it hints at a later section in the Advanced User Guide regarding altering the default status codes.

They are just a convenience, they hold the same number, but that way you can use the editor's autocomplete to find them:

Technical Details
You could also use `from starlette import status`.
**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.status` as `fastapi.status` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

Later, in the [Advanced User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/), you will see how to return a different status code than the default you are declaring here.

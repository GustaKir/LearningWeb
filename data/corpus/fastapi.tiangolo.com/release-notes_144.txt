## 0.52.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0520 "Permanent link")
  * Add new high-performance JSON response class using `orjson`. New docs: [Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others: `ORJSONResponse`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#use-orjsonresponse). PR [#1065](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1065).


## 0.51.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0510 "Permanent link")
  * Re-export utils from Starlette:
    * This allows using things like `from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse` instead of `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.
    * It's mainly syntax sugar, a convenience for developer experience.
    * Now `Request`, `Response`, `WebSocket`, `status` can be imported directly from `fastapi` as in `from fastapi import Response`. This is because those are frequently used, to use the request directly, to set headers and cookies, to get status codes, etc.
    * Documentation changes in many places, but new docs and noticeable improvements:
      * [Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/).
      * [Advanced Middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/middleware/).
      * [Including WSGI - Flask, Django, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/wsgi/).
    * PR [#1064](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1064).

Title: Deployment Concepts for ASGI Servers
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/
Summary: This section discusses the use of ASGI servers like Uvicorn for deploying applications, highlighting the importance of the `--reload` option for development while advising against its use in production. It introduces key deployment concepts such as security, startup processes, restarts, replication, and memory management, setting the stage for more detailed explanations.

Each alternative ASGI server program would have a similar command, you can read more in their respective documentation.
Warning
Uvicorn and other servers support a `--reload` option that is useful during development.
The `--reload` option consumes much more resources, is more unstable, etc.
It helps a lot during **development** , but you **shouldn't** use it in **production**.
## Deployment Concepts[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#deployment-concepts "Permanent link")
These examples run the server program (e.g Uvicorn), starting **a single process** , listening on all the IPs (`0.0.0.0`) on a predefined port (e.g. `80`).
This is the basic idea. But you will probably want to take care of some additional things, like:
  * Security - HTTPS
  * Running on startup
  * Restarts
  * Replication (the number of processes running)
  * Memory
  * Previous steps before starting


I'll tell you more about each of these concepts, how to think about them, and some concrete examples with strategies to handle them in the next chapters. ðŸš€

Title: Inspiration Behind FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/
Summary: FastAPI was inspired by the need for a framework that combines data validation, serialization, and documentation using Python types. The creator found APIStar to be the best alternative before it ceased operation, leading to the development of Starlette. FastAPI is considered a spiritual successor to APIStar, enhancing features and typing based on previous frameworks.

Inspired **FastAPI** to
Exist.
The idea of declaring multiple things (data validation, serialization and documentation) with the same Python types, that at the same time provided great editor support, was something I considered a brilliant idea.
And after searching for a long time for a similar framework and testing many different alternatives, APIStar was the best option available.
Then APIStar stopped to exist as a server and Starlette was created, and was a new better foundation for such a system. That was the final inspiration to build **FastAPI**.
I consider **FastAPI** a "spiritual successor" to APIStar, while improving and increasing the features, typing system, and other parts, based on the learnings from all these previous tools.
## Used by **FastAPI**[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/#used-by-fastapi "Permanent link")
### [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/#pydantic "Permanent link")
Pydantic is a library to define data validation, serialization and documentation (using JSON Schema) based on Python type hints.
That makes it extremely intuitive.
It is comparable to Marshmallow. Although it's faster than Marshmallow in benchmarks. And as it is based on the same Python type hints, the editor support is great.
**FastAPI** uses it to
Handle all the data validation, data serialization and automatic model documentation (based on JSON Schema).
**FastAPI** then takes that JSON Schema data and puts it in OpenAPI, apart from all the other things it does.
### [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/#starlette "Permanent link")
Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services.
It is very simple and intuitive. It's designed to be easily extensible, and have modular components.
It has:
  * Seriously impressive performance.
  * WebSocket support.
  * In-process background tasks.
  * Startup and shutdown events.
  * Test client built on HTTPX.
  * CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
  * Session and Cookie support.
  * 100% test coverage.
  * 100% type annotated codebase.
  * Few hard dependencies.

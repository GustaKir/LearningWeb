  * 👥 Update FastAPI People. PR [#4274](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4274) by [@github-actions[bot]](https://github.com/apps/github-actions).


## 0.70.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0700 "Permanent link")
This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, `0.16.0`, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.
These last **three consecutive releases** are independent so that you can **migrate gradually** :
  * First to FastAPI `0.68.2`, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies.
  * Next to FastAPI `0.69.0`, which upgrades Starlette to `0.15.0`, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code.
  * Finally to FastAPI `0.70.0`, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version `0.16.0` with additional bug fixes.


This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨

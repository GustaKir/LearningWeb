### Breaking Changes - Upgrade[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#breaking-changes-upgrade_1 "Permanent link")
This release adds support for [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ✨
It upgrades the version of Starlette to `0.15.0`, now based on [AnyIO](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the internal async components in **FastAPI** are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both **asyncio** and **Trio**.
You can read the docs about running [FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#hypercorn-with-trio).
This release also removes `graphene` as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/). You can read the new [FastAPI with GraphQL docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/graphql/).

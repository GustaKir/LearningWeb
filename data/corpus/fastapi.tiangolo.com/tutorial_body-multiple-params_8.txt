Title: Recap on Body Parameters in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-multiple-params/
Summary: FastAPI allows the addition of multiple body parameters to a path operation function, despite a request containing only one body. It provides correct data handling, validation, and schema documentation. Additionally, singular values can be included in the body, and FastAPI can embed the body within a key even for a single declared parameter.

## Recap[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-multiple-params/#recap "Permanent link")
You can add multiple body parameters to your _path operation function_ , even though a request can only have a single body.
But **FastAPI** will handle it, give you the correct data in your function, and validate and document the correct schema in the _path operation_.
You can also declare singular values to be received as part of the body.
And you can instruct **FastAPI** to embed the body in a key even when there is only a single parameter declared.

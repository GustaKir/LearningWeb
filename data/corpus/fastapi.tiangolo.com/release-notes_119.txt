## 0.68.2[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0682 "Permanent link")
This release has **no breaking changes**. 🎉
It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.
Soon there will be a new FastAPI release upgrading Starlette to take advantage of recent improvements, but as that has a higher chance of having breaking changes, it will be in a separate release.

Title: Getting Started with FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/
Summary: This section emphasizes the importance of writing and running FastAPI code locally to fully appreciate its benefits, such as reduced code length and enhanced features like type checks and autocompletion. It outlines the steps for installing FastAPI, including creating a virtual environment and using pip to install either the standard version with optional dependencies or the basic version.

```

It is **HIGHLY encouraged** that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.
Using it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.
## Install FastAPI[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#install-fastapi "Permanent link")
The first step is to install FastAPI.
Make sure you create a [virtual environment](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/), activate it, and then **install FastAPI** :
```

fast →[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)pip install "fastapi[standard]"restart ↻[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)

```

Note
When you install with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with some default optional standard dependencies.
If you don't want to have those optional dependencies, you can instead install `pip install fastapi`.
## Advanced User Guide[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#advanced-user-guide "Permanent link")
There is also an **Advanced User Guide** that you can read later after this **Tutorial - User guide**.
The **Advanced User Guide** builds on this one, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.
But you should first read the **Tutorial - User Guide** (what you are reading right now).
It's designed so that you can build a complete application with just the **Tutorial - User Guide** , and then extend it in different ways, depending on your needs, using some of the additional ideas from the **Advanced User Guide**.

You can study about databases, SQL, and SQLModel in the [SQLModel docs](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/). ðŸ¤“
There's a mini [tutorial on using SQLModel with FastAPI](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/). âœ¨
That tutorial includes a section about [testing SQL databases](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/tests/). ðŸ˜Ž

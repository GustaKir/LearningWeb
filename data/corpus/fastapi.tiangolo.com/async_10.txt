Title: Asynchronous Dependencies in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/
Summary: This section discusses how dependencies and sub-dependencies in FastAPI can be defined using both `def` and `async def`, detailing that standard functions are run using an external threadpool. It explains the flexibility of having mixed dependency types and their execution context.

framework.
### Dependencies[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#dependencies "Permanent link")
The same applies for [dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/). If a dependency is a standard `def` function instead of `async def`, it is run in the external threadpool.
### Sub-dependencies[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#sub-dependencies "Permanent link")
You can have multiple dependencies and [sub-dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/) requiring each other (as parameters of the function definitions), some of them might be created with `async def` and some with normal `def`. It would still work, and the ones created with normal `def` would be called on an external thread (from the threadpool) instead of being "awaited".
### Other utility functions[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#other-utility-functions "Permanent link")
Any other utility function that you call directly can be created with normal `def` or `async def` and FastAPI won't affect the way you call it.
This is in contrast to the functions that FastAPI calls for you: _path operation functions_ and dependencies.
If your utility function is a normal function with `def`, it will be called directly (as you write it in your code), not in a threadpool, if the function is created with `async def` then you should `await` for that function when you call it in your code.
Again, these are very technical details that would probably be useful if you came searching for them.
Otherwise, you should be good with the guidelines from the section above: [In a hurry?](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry).

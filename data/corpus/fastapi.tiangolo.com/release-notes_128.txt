## 0.62.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0620 "Permanent link")
### Features[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#features_39 "Permanent link")
  * ✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).


Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of _path operations_ was in `include_router`. That works well, but the call to `app.include_router()` or `router.include_router()` is normally done in another file.
That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the _path operations_ in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.
Setting options in `include_router` still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the `APIRouter`.
**In`FastAPI`**
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
  * `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`.
  * `dependencies`: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
  * `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the _path operations_.
  * `deprecated`: to mark all the _path operations_ as deprecated. 🤷
  * `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the _path operations_ from the OpenAPI schema.
  * `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the _path operations_.


For example:
```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI, Depends
async defsome_dependency():
  return
app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])

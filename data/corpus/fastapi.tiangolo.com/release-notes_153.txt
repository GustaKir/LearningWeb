Title: FastAPI Release Notes: Versions 0.29.0 and 0.28.0
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: Version 0.29.0 introduces support for declaring a `Response` parameter to handle response cookies, headers, and custom status codes. It maintains compatibility with returning various object types. Version 0.28.0 adds dependency caching per request to prevent multiple calls to the same dependency during a single request.

## 0.29.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0290 "Permanent link")
  * Add support for declaring a `Response` parameter:
    * This allows declaring:
      * [Response Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-cookies/).
      * [Response Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-headers/).
      * An HTTP Status Code different than the default: [Response - Change Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/).
    * All of this while still being able to return arbitrary objects (`dict`, DB model, etc).
    * Update attribution to Hug, for inspiring the `response` parameter pattern.
    * PR [#294](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/294).


## 0.28.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0280 "Permanent link")
  * Implement dependency cache per request.
    * This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
    * This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
    * This also means that if a dependency was declared as a _path operation decorator_ dependency, possibly at the router level (with `.include_router()`) and then it is declared again in a specific _path operation_ , the dependency will be called only once.
    * The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using `use_cache=False` as in `Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)`.
    * Updated docs at: [Using the same dependency multiple times](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/#using-the-same-dependency-multiple-times).
    * PR [#292](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/292).
  * Implement dependency overrides for testing.
    * This allows using overrides/mocks of dependencies during tests.
    * New docs: [Testing Dependencies with Overrides](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/testing-dependencies/).
    * PR [#291](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/291).


## 0.27.2[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0272 "Permanent link")
  * Fix path and query parameters receiving `dict` as a valid type. It should be mapped to a body payload. PR [#287](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/287). Updated docs at: [Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults: Using `list`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#using-list).


## 0.27.1[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0271 "Permanent link")
  * Fix `auto_error=False` handling in `HTTPBearer` security scheme. Do not `raise` when there's an incorrect `Authorization` header if `auto_error=False`. PR [#282](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/282).
  * Fix type declaration of `HTTPException`. PR [#279](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/279).


## 0.27.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0270 "Permanent link")
  * Fix broken link in docs about OAuth 2.0 with scopes. PR [#275](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/275) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).
  * Refactor param extraction using Pydantic `Field`:
    * Large refactor, improvement, and simplification of param extraction from _path operations_.
    * Fix/add support for list _query parameters_ with list defaults. New documentation: [Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#query-parameter-list-multiple-values-with-defaults).
    * Add support for enumerations in _path operation_ parameters. New documentation: [Path Parameters: Predefined values](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/#predefined-values).
    * Add support for type annotations using `Optional` as in `param: Optional[str] = None`. New documentation: [Optional type declarations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/#optional-type-declarations).
    * PR [#278](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/278).

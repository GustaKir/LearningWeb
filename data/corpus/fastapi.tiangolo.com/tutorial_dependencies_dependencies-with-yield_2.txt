Title: Dependencies with Yield in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/
Summary: This section covers the usage of dependencies in FastAPI that utilize the `yield` statement. It discusses scenarios involving HTTP exceptions and error handling with `except`, and emphasizes the importance of raising exceptions correctly. Additionally, it explains the execution flow of these dependencies and their relation to background tasks.

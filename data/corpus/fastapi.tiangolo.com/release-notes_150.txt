## 0.36.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0360 "Permanent link")

  * Allow having empty paths in _path operations_ used with `include_router` and a `prefix`.
    * This allows having a router for `/cats` and all its _path operations_ , while having one of them for `/cats`.
    * Now it doesn't have to be only `/cats/` (with a trailing slash).
    * To use it, declare the path in the _path operation_ as the empty string (`""`).
    * PR [#415](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/415) by [@vitalik](https://github.com/vitalik).

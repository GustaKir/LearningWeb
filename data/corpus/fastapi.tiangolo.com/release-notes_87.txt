URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: This section discusses updates in FastAPI, including the deprecation of the `regex` parameter in favor of `pattern`, the introduction of improved Pydantic model configuration with `model_config`, and changes to the `schema_extra` attribute. Additionally, it notes that installing FastAPI with all dependencies now includes new components.
---

...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.
  * The parameter `regex` has been deprecated and replaced by `pattern`.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Query Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#add-regular-expressions).
  * New Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute `model_config` that takes a simple dict instead of an internal class `Config` for their configuration.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
  * The attribute `schema_extra` for the internal class `Config` has been replaced by the key `json_schema_extra` in the new `model_config` dict.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
  * When you install `"fastapi[all]"` it now also includes:
    * [`pydantic-settings`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/) - for settings management.
    * [`pydantic-extra-types`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/) - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.
  * Now Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in `"fastapi[all]"`). To use settings you should now import `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings` instead of importing from `pydantic` directly.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Settings and Environment Variables](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/).
  * PR [#9816](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/9816) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), included all the work done (in multiple PRs) on the beta branch (`main-pv2`).

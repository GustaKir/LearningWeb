Title: Transition from OpenAPI `examples` to JSON Schema `examples`
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/
Summary: FastAPI has updated the OpenAPI-specific `examples` parameter to `openapi_examples` since version 0.103.0, aligning with the new `examples` field in JSON Schema 2020-12. This new field is a simple list of examples, replacing the deprecated single `example` field. Despite this update, Swagger UI initially did not fully support the changes introduced with OpenAPI 3.1.0.
---

Info
This old OpenAPI-specific `examples` parameter is now `openapi_examples` since FastAPI `0.103.0`.
### JSON Schema's `examples` field[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/#json-schemas-examples-field "Permanent link")
But then JSON Schema added an [`examples`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.9.5) field to a new version of the specification.
And then the new OpenAPI 3.1.0 was based on the latest version (JSON Schema 2020-12) that included this new field `examples`.
And now this new `examples` field takes precedence over the old single (and custom) `example` field, that is now deprecated.
This new `examples` field in JSON Schema is **just a`list`** of examples, not a dict with extra metadata as in the other places in OpenAPI (described above).
Info
Even after OpenAPI 3.1.0 was released with this new simpler integration with JSON Schema, for a while, Swagger UI, the tool that provides the automatic docs, didn't support OpenAPI 3.1.0 (it does since version 5.0.0 ðŸŽ‰).
Because of that, versions of FastAPI previous to 0.99.0 still used versions of OpenAPI lower than 3.1.0.
### Pydantic and FastAPI `examples`[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/#pydantic-and-fastapi-examples "Permanent link")
When you add `examples` inside a Pydantic model, using `schema_extra` or `Field(examples=["something"])` that example is added to the **JSON Schema** for that Pydantic model.
And that **JSON Schema** of the Pydantic model is included in the **OpenAPI** of your API, and then it's used in the docs UI.
In versions of FastAPI before 0.99.0 (0.99.0 and above use the newer OpenAPI 3.1.0) when you used `example` or `examples` with any of the other utilities (`Query()`, `Body()`, etc.) those examples were not added to the JSON Schema that describes that data (not even to OpenAPI's own version of JSON Schema), they were added directly to the _path operation_ declaration in OpenAPI (outside the parts of OpenAPI that use JSON Schema).
But now that FastAPI 0.99.0 and above uses OpenAPI 3.1.0, that uses JSON Schema 2020-12, and Swagger UI 5.0.0 and above, everything is more consistent and the examples are included in JSON Schema.
### Swagger UI and OpenAPI-specific `examples`[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/#swagger-ui-and-openapi-specific-examples "Permanent link")
Now, as Swagger UI didn't support multiple JSON Schema examples (as of 2023-08-26), users didn't have a way to show multiple examples in the docs.
To solve that, FastAPI `0.103.0` **added support** for declaring the same old **OpenAPI-specific** `examples` field with the new parameter `openapi_examples`. ðŸ¤“
### Summary[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/#summary "Permanent link")
I used to say I didn't like history that much... and look at me now giving "tech history" lessons. ðŸ˜…
In short, **upgrade to FastAPI 0.99.0 or above** , and things are much **simpler, consistent, and intuitive** , and you don't have to know all these historic details. ðŸ˜Ž

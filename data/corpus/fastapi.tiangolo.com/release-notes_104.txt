## 0.82.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0820 "Permanent link")
🚨 This is probably the last release (or one of the last releases) to support Python 3.6. 🔥
Python 3.6 reached the [end-of-life and is no longer supported by Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3615/) since around a year ago.
You hopefully updated to a supported version of Python a while ago. If you haven't, you really should.

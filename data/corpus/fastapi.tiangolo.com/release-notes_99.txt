Title: FastAPI Release Notes Summary
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: FastAPI will now use return type annotations for data validation, automatic documentation, and data filtering, which was previously only available through the `response_model` parameter. The release notes also highlight updates in documentation, including the addition of external resources and corrections of typos in various documents.

```

FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:
  * Data validation
  * Automatic documentation
    * It could power automatic client generators
  * **Data filtering**


Before this version it was only supported via the `response_model` parameter.

# `Request` class[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/request/#request-class "Permanent link")
You can declare a parameter in a _path operation function_ or dependency to be of type `Request` and then you can access the raw request object directly, without any validation, etc.
You can import it directly from `fastapi`:
```
fromfastapiimport Request

```

Tip
When you want to define dependencies that should be compatible with both HTTP and WebSockets, you can define a parameter that takes an `HTTPConnection` instead of a `Request` or a `WebSocket`.
##  fastapi.Request [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/request/#fastapi.Request "Permanent link")
```
Request(scope, receive=empty_receive, send=empty_send)

Title: Benefits of Automatically Generated Clients in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/
Summary: Automated client generation in FastAPI provides clean method names, autocompletion for methods and request/response payloads, as well as inline error reporting. Updates to the backend are seamlessly reflected in the client code, ensuring consistency and helping to detect data mismatches.

After generating the new client, you would now have **clean method names** , with all the **autocompletion** , **inline errors** , etc:

## Benefits[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#benefits "Permanent link")
When using the automatically generated clients you would get **autocompletion** for:
  * Methods.
  * Request payloads in the body, query parameters, etc.
  * Response payloads.


You would also have **inline errors** for everything.
And whenever you update the backend code, and **regenerate** the frontend, it would have any new _path operations_ available as methods, the old ones removed, and any other change would be reflected on the generated code. ðŸ¤“
This also means that if something changed it will be **reflected** on the client code automatically. And if you **build** the client it will error out if you have any **mismatch** in the data used.
So, you would **detect many errors** very early in the development cycle instead of having to wait for the errors to show up to your final users in production and then trying to debug where the problem is. âœ¨

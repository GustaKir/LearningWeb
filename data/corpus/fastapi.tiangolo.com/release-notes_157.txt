## 0.13.0[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#0130 "Permanent link")

    * Improve `Security` handling, merging scopes when declaring `SecurityScopes`.
    * Allow using `SecurityBase` (like `OAuth2`) classes with `Depends` and still document them. `Security` now is needed only to declare `scopes`.
    * Updated docs about: [OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/).

    * `responses` can also be added to `.include_router()`, the updated docs are here: [Bigger Applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#add-some-custom-tags-and-responses).

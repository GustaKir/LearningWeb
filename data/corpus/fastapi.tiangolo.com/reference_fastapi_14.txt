URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This section describes how to configure contact information for an exposed API in FastAPI. It details the fields that can be included in the contact dictionary, such as name, URL, and email, and explains their formats. The provided example demonstrates how to set this information in a FastAPI application, which will be reflected in the generated OpenAPI documentation.

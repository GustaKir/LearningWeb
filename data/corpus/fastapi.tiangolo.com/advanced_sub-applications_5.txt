Title: Sub-Applications in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/
Summary: This section explains how to view the automatic API documentation for the main application and a sub-application in FastAPI. It covers accessing the docs at specific URLs and notes that each user interface operates correctly due to proper communication between the main app and sub-app.

```

And open the docs at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.
You will see the automatic API docs for the main app, including only its own _path operations_ :

And then, open the docs for the sub-application, at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs>.
You will see the automatic API docs for the sub-application, including only its own _path operations_ , all under the correct sub-path prefix `/subapi`:

If you try interacting with any of the two user interfaces, they will work correctly, because the browser will be able to talk to each specific app or sub-app.
### Technical Details: `root_path`[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/#technical-details-root_path "Permanent link")
When you mount a sub-application as described above, FastAPI will take care of communicating the mount path for the sub-application using a mechanism from the ASGI specification called a `root_path`.
That way, the sub-application will know to use that path prefix for the docs UI.
And the sub-application could also have its own mounted sub-applications and everything would work correctly, because FastAPI handles all these `root_path`s automatically.
You will learn more about the `root_path` and how to use it explicitly in the section about [Behind a Proxy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/).

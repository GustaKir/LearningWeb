Title: Notes on Direct Response in FastAPI
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/
Summary: This section explains that when returning a Response directly in FastAPI, automatic validation, conversion, and documentation do not occur. However, documentation can still be added as per the guidelines for Additional Responses in OpenAPI. Further details on using custom Responses with automatic features will be covered in subsequent sections.

## Notes[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/#notes "Permanent link")
When you return a `Response` directly its data is not validated, converted (serialized), nor documented automatically.
But you can still document it as described in [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/).
You can see in later sections how to use/declare these custom `Response`s while still having automatic data conversion, documentation, etc.

Title: Guidelines for Seeking Help with FastAPI Problems
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/
Summary: This document outlines two key steps for receiving help with FastAPI issues: 1) Reproduce the problem by requesting a minimal, reproducible example from the user to understand the context better, and 2) Suggest solutions based on the clarified problem. It emphasizes the importance of a complete code snippet for effective troubleshooting.

### Reproduce the problem[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#reproduce-the-problem "Permanent link")
For most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's **original code**.
In many cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to **reproduce the problem**.
  * You can ask them to provide a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example), that you can **copy-paste** and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to understand their use case better.
  * If you are feeling too generous, you can try to **create an example** like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just keep in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.


### Suggest solutions[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#suggest-solutions "Permanent link")
  * After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible **answer**.
  * In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem or use case** , because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.


### Ask to close[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#ask-to-close "Permanent link")
If they reply, there's a high chance you would have solved their problem, congrats, **you're a hero**! ðŸ¦¸
  * Now, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:
    * In GitHub Discussions: mark the comment as the **answer**.
    * In GitHub Issues: **close** the issue.


## Watch the GitHub repository[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#watch-the-github-repository "Permanent link")
You can "watch" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi>. ðŸ‘€
If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue or question. You can also specify that you only want to be notified about new issues, or discussions, or PRs, etc.
Then you can try and help them solve those questions.
## Ask Questions[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#ask-questions "Permanent link")
You can [create a new question](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions) in the GitHub repository, for example to:
  * Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
  * Suggest a new **feature**.


**Note** : if you do it, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. ðŸ˜‰
## Review Pull Requests[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#review-pull-requests "Permanent link")
You can help me review pull requests from others.
Again, please try your best to be kind. ðŸ¤—
Here's what to keep in mind and how to review a pull request:
### Understand the problem[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#understand-the-problem "Permanent link")
  * First, make sure you **understand the problem** that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.
  * There's also a good chance that the pull request is not actually needed because the problem can be solved in a **different way**. Then you can suggest or ask about that.


### Don't worry about style[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#dont-worry-about-style "Permanent link")
  * Don't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.
  * Also don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.


And if there's any other style or consistency need, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.
### Check the code[Â¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#check-the-code "Permanent link")
  * Check and read the code, see if it makes sense, **run it locally** and see if it actually solves the problem.
  * Then **comment** saying that you did that, that's how I will know you really checked it.


Info
Unfortunately, I can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.
Several times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5 or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are actually broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. ðŸ˜…
So, it's really important that you actually read and run the code, and let me know in the comments that you did. ðŸ¤“
  * If the PR can be simplified in a way, you can ask for that, but there's no need to be too picky, there might be a lot of subjective points of view (and I will have my own as well ðŸ™ˆ), so it's better if you can focus on the fundamental things.

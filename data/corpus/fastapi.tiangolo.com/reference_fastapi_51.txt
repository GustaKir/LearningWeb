Title: FastAPI Path Operation Customization
URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/
Summary: This section discusses how to customize the operation ID for path operations in FastAPI, emphasizing the importance of uniqueness for the API. It also covers configuring response models to include specific fields using Pydantic, with references to detailed documentation on these features.

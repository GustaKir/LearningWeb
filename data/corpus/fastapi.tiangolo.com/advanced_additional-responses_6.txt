To see what exactly you can include in the responses, you can check these sections in the OpenAPI specification:
  * [OpenAPI Responses Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#responses-object), it includes the `Response Object`.
  * [OpenAPI Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#response-object), you can include anything from this directly in each response inside your `responses` parameter. Including `description`, `headers`, `content` (inside of this is that you declare different media types and JSON Schemas), and `links`.

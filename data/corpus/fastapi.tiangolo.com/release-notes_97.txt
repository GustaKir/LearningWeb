URL: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/
Summary: This release upgrades the Starlette version to 0.24.0 and refactors internal components for enhanced compatibility, addressing issues with middleware instances being improperly created. It ensures that middleware classes are instantiated only once before the first request, resolving nuanced errors associated with previous versions.

### Upgrades[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#upgrades_17 "Permanent link")
  * ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to `0.24.0` and refactor internals for compatibility. PR [#5985](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5985) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette `0.24.0`, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks [@adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)! Starlette PR [#2017](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2017)). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called).
    * If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.
